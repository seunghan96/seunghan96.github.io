Semi-supervised Learning

- mostly on CV â€¦.. not on TS

<br>

This paper : discuss the **transferability** of SOTA models from **image to TS**

- model backbone
- data augmentation strategies

<br>

# 1. Introduciton

Question : ***Can we transfer SOTA SSL models from image to TS?***

- SOTA models : MixMatch, Virtual Adversarial Training, Mean Teacher, Ladder Net

<br>

2 modifications

- (1) modification of a suitable backbone architecture
- (2) adaptions of an appropriate DA strategy
