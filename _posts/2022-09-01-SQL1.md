# Chapter 1. Introduction

### (1) DBMS

- provides environment that is both **convenient & efficient** to use

<br>

### (2) Architecture of DB system

<br>

### (3) Data Models

Data Models ?

- collection of tools, for describing ***data, data relationships, data semantics, data constraints***
- ex 1) ER model ( Entity-Relationship model )
- ex 2) Object-oriented model, Semi-structured data model, Network mdoel, Hierarchical model

<br>

**ER model ( Entity-Relationship model )**

### (4) DDL, DML

DDL ( Data **DEFINITION** Language )

- for **defining** DB structure

- ex) **CREATE TABLE**
- In addition, it updates a special set of tables called the "data dictionary"



DML ( Data **MANIPULATION** Language )

- for **accessing & manipulating** data
- Procedural vs Declarative DML
  - [ Procedural ] user need to specify **"WHAT"** data are needed & **"HOW"** to get them
  - [ Declarative ] user need to specify only **"WHAT"** data are needed 
- (term) query language $\approx$ DML
  - mostly used query language : ***SQL***

<br>

### (5) DB access from applications

Application programs?

- programs used to **interact with DB**

- usually written in **host language** ( ex. Python, Java ... )

- access DB via one of...
  - (1) **language extensions** to allow embedded SQL
  - (2) **API** ( Application Program Interface )

<br>

Application architecture

- 2-tier architecture
  - ex) client programs using ODBC/JDBC to communicate with a database
- 3-tier architecture
  - ex) web-based applications

### (6) Overall DB system structure

<br>

### (7) Query Processing

- step 1) parsing & translation
- step 2) optimization
- step 3) evaluation

<br>

### (8) Storage Management

- program module that provides the **interface** between ..
  - (1) low-level data ( stored in DB & application programs )
  - (2) queries ( submitted to the system )
- issues : storage access, file organization, indexing/hashing

<br>

## (9) History of DB system

1. 1960s~1970s :

   - network & hierarchical data models

   - relational data model

2. 1980s :

   - SQL
   - parallel & distributed DB
   - Objected-oriented DB

3. 1990s :

   - decision support & data mining applications
   - data warehouses

4. 2000s :

   - XML & XQuery

5. 2010s

   - Big data

   - Giant data storage systems

     ( Google BigTable, Hadoop, ...)
