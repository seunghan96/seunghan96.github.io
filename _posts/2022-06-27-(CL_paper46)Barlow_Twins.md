# 0. Abstract

Issue in SSL : ***existence of trivial constant solutions***

Solution : propose a new objective function

<br>

***Barlow Twins*** 

- Proposed objective function : 
  - avoids collapse by **measuring the cross-correlation matrix** between the **outputs of two identical networks** fed with **distorted versions** of a sample

- does not require large batches 
- does not require other etc â€¦
  - asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the weight updates

## (1) Description of Barlow Twins

produces two distorted views ( via data augmentations $$\mathcal{T}$$ )

- distorted views $$Y^A$$ and $$Y^B$$

<br>

Feed two views to $$f_\theta$$

- produces embeddings $$Z^A$$ and $$Z^B$$ 

  ( mean centered along the batch dimension )

<br>

Innovative loss function $$\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{B} \mathcal{T}}$$ :

$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{B} \mathcal{T}} \triangleq \underbrace{\sum_i\left(1-\mathcal{C}_{i i}\right)^2}_{\text {invariance term }}+\lambda \underbrace{\sum_i \sum_{j \neq i} \mathcal{C}_{i j}^2}_{\text {redundancy reduction term }}$$.

- $$\mathcal{C}$$ :cross-correlation matrix,
  - between the outputs of the two identical networks along the batch dimension
  - $$\mathcal{C}_{i j} \triangleq \frac{\sum_b z_{b, i}^A z_{b, j}^B}{\sqrt{\sum_b\left(z_{b, i}^A\right)^2} \sqrt{\sum_b\left(z_{b, j}^B\right)^2}}$$.
- (loss term 1) invariance term
  - encourage diagonal term to be 1
- (loss term 2) redundancy reduction term
  - encourage the off-diagonal term to be close to zero
