# Chapter 9. Indexing and Hashing

<br>

## (1) Basic Concepts

Indexing mechanisms 

- used to **speed up access** to desired data

<br>

Search Key :

- set of attributes used to **look up records** in a file

<br>

Index file ...

- consists of records (called index entries) of the form **search-key & pointer**
- typically much **smaller than the original file**

<br>

2 basic kinds of indices

- (1) ordered indices
  - search keys are stored in **sorted order**
- (2) hash indices
  - search keys are **distributed uniformly across “buckets”** using a **“hash function”**

<br>

## (2) Ordered Indicies

( stored in **sorted order** of search key value )

If the file containing the records is sequentially ordered...

- (1) **primary index**

  ( = also called clustering index )

  - index whose search key **also defines the sequential order** of the file

- (2) **secondary index**

  ( = also called non-clustering index )

  - index whose search key **specifies an order different from the sequential order** of the file

<br>

Indexed sequential file : 

- sequential file with a primary index

<br>

### Primary Index : Dense Index Files

- data의 **"모든 key가 index에서 표현"**

- Dense Index : **"key들을 data의 순서와 동일하게 유지"**

- Index : key & pointer만을 보유

  $$\rightarrow$$ data 자체보다 훨씬 적은 공간 소모

<br>

### Primary Index : Sparse Index Files

- (Dense Index) 모든 key를 가지고 있기엔, data가 너무 많음

  $$\rightarrow$$ 이를 보완하기 위한 것이 Sparse Index

- data (X) data block (O) 마다 1개의 key-pointer 쌍을 가짐

- 장 & 단 ( vs. Dense Index )

  - 장) 훨씬 적은 공간을 사용
  - 단) 주어진 record의 key를 찾는데 더 많은 시간 걸림

### Primary Index : Multilevel Index Files

### Secondary Index

<br>

## (3) B$$^{+}$$-Tree Index Files

( = alternative to indexed-sequential files )

<br>

Indexed-sequential files의 단점

- ***Performance degrades as file grows***

  ( many overflow blocks get created for index files )

- ***Periodic reorganization of entire index file is required***

<br>

B$$^{+}$$-Tree Index Files의 장점

- ***automatically reorganizes itself*** with small and local changes
- ***Reorganization of entire file is not required*** to maintain performance

<br>

B$$^{+}$$-Tree Index Files의 단점

- extra insertion and deletion overhead, space overhead

<br>

B$$^{+}$$-Tree Index Files의 특징

- All paths from root to leaf are of the same length
- Each node that is not a root or a leaf has between $$\lceil\mathrm{n} / 2\rceil$$ and $$n$$ children
- A leaf node that is not a root has between $$n\lceil(n-1) / 2\rceil$$ and $$n-1$$ values
- Root must have at least two children

<br>

### Node의 구조

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img65.png)

- $$K_i$$ : search-key
- $$P_i$$ : pointers ...
  - to children ( for non-leaf nodes )
  - to records ( for leaf nodes )

- $$K_i$$s in a node are ordered as...
  - $$K_1 < \cdots K_{n-1}$$.

<br>

### Leaf Nodes

- ( For $$i$$ = 1, 2, …, n-1 ) $$P_i$$  either points to ...
  - (1) a **file record** with $$K_i$$
  - (2) a **bucket of pointers to file records** 
- ( $$L_i$$ : leaf node $$i$$ ) if $$i < j$$ , $$L_i$$'s search-key < $$L_j$$'s search-key

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img66.png)

<br>

### Non-Leaf Nodes

- form a **multi-level sparse index** on the leaf nodes.

- For a non-leaf node with $$m$$ pointers ...

  - (1) All the **search-keys in the subtree to which $$P_1$$ points** < $$K_1$$
  - (2) All the **search-keys in the subtree to which $$P_m$$ points** $$\geq$$  $$K_{m-1}$$

  - (3) ( For $$2 \leq i \leq m-1$$ ) 
    - $$K_{i-1}$$ $$\leq$$ All the **search-keys in the subtree to which $$P_i$$ points** <$$K_{i}$$

### Queries On B$$^+$$-Trees

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img68.png)

<br>

### B$$^+$$-Tree Insertion

- filled from **bottom**
- Perform a search to find a **target leaf node for the new entry**
  - (a) if the leaf node is NOT FULL
    - **add the entry**
  - (b) if the leaf node is FULL
    - b-1) **split the node into 2 parts**
    - b-2) 
      - 1st half entries are stored in **one node**
      - 2nd half entries are moved to a **new node**
    - b-3) The first entry of a **new node** is **copied** to the **parent of the leaf**
- *If a non-leaf node overflows:*
  - b-1) SAME
  - b-2) SAME
  - b-3) The first entry of a **new node** is **moved** to the **parent of the node**

<br>

### B$$^+$$-Tree Deletion

- The target entry is **searched** &**deleted** at the leaf node

- If underflow occurs after deletion,

  $$\rightarrow$$  distribute the entries from the node **left** to it

- If distribution is not possible from left,

  $$\rightarrow$$ distribute from the node **right** to it

- If distribution is not possible from left or from right,

  $$\rightarrow$$ **merge the node** with left and right to it

## (4) B-Tree Index Files

### B-Tree vs B$$^+$$-Tree

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img74.png)

<br>

### Details

- allows search-key values to **appear only once**

  ( = eliminates redundant storage of search keys )

- search keys in non-leaf nodes appear **no where else in the B-tree**
  -  an additional pointer field for each search key in a non-leaf node must be included

<br>

### Advantages of B-Tree indices:

- use less tree nodes than a corresponding B+-Tree

- Sometimes possible to find search-key value before reaching leaf node

<br>

### Disadvantages of B-Tree indices:

- Non-leaf nodes are larger ( keeps data in it )

  -> typically have greater depth than corresponding B+-Tree

- Insertion and deletion more complicated than in B+-Trees

- Implementation is harder than B+-Trees
