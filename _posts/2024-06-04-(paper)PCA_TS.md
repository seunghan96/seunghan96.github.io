# 0. Abstract

Inherent complexity of TS datasets

$$\rightarrow$$ This paper: focuses on ***reducing redundant information***

- to elevate forecasting accuracy 
- while optimizing runtime efficiency. 

<br>

Propose ***Transformer + Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*** 

<br>

# 1. Introduction

Task : LTSF with MTS

<br>

Trend of Google Scholarâ€™s publications on Transformer techniques since 2017. 

<br>

Dimension reduction

- Existing approaches to dimensionality reduction in datasets for **transformer models** remain insufficient.

<br>

Contribution

1. Present aa benchmark test on transformer-based MTS forecasting with PCA
2. Proposed framework can significantly enhance LTSF performance
3. Comprehensive study 
   - Detailed and interpretable insights for model transparency, 
   - Interpretability and explainability of multivariate analysis
