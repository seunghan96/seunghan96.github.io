# Flamingo: a Visual Language Model for Few-Shot Learning

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.14198

<br>

# 1. Abstract

### Flamingo

- A family of VLMs
- Rapid adapted to **novel tasks** using **only a handful of annotated examples** 
- Key architectural innovations
  - (1) **Bridge** powerful pretrained vision & language models
  - (2) Handle sequences of **arbitrarily interleaved** visual and textual data
  - (3) Ingest images or videos as inputs
- Trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing **arbitrarily interleaved text and images**

<br>

# 2. Approach

Flamingo = VLM with...

- Input: **Text interleaved with images/videos** 
- Output: **Free-form text**

<br>

Key architectural components

- To leverage pretrained vision and language models and bridge them effectively
- **(1) Perceiver Resampler**
  - **Input**: Receives spatio-temporal features from the Vision Encoder
  - **Output**: Fixed number of visual tokens
- **(2) Cross-attention layers**
  - Visual tokens are used to condition the frozen LM! 
  - Offer an expressive way for the LM to incorporate visual information for the next-token prediction task!
  - $$p(y \mid x)=\prod_{\ell=1}^L p\left(y_{\ell} \mid y_{<\ell}, x_{\leq \ell}\right)$$.
