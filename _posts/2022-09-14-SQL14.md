# (1) Failure Classification

## a) Transaction failure

(1) Logical errors : 

- **transaction cannot complete**, due to some **logical error condition**

<br>

(2) System errors: 

- the **DB system must terminate an active transaction** due to an **error condition (e.g., deadlock)**

<br>

(3) System crash: 

- a **power failure** or other **hardware or software failure** causes the system to crash

<br>

(4) Disk failure: 

- a head crash or similar disk failure destroys **all or part of disk storage**

<br>

## b) Recovery Algorithms

Definition )

- techniques to ensure **(1) DB consistency**, **(2) transaction atomicity**, and **(3) durability** despite failures

<br>

Consists of 2 parts :

- (1)  Actions taken ***DURING*** normal transaction processing
  - to **ensure enough information exists** to recover from failures 

- (2) Actions taken ***AFTER*** a failure 
  - to **recover** the DB contents to a state that ensures atomicity, consistency, and durability 

<br>

## c) Data Access

Definitions )

- **Physical blocks** : blocks residing on the disk

- **Buffer blocks** : blocks residing temporarily in main memory

<br>

**Block movements** between disk & main memory :

- are initiated through **input**(B) and **output**(B) operations

<br>

Each transaction $$T_i$$ has its **"private work-area"**,

where **local copies of all data items** accessed and updated by $$T_i$$ are kept

<br>

( for simplicity, assume that **each data item fits in a single block** )

<br>

Transaction transfers data items between **(1) buffer blocks** & **(2) its private work-area** using **read**(X) and **write**(X) operations

<br>

Transactions

- Perform **read**(X) when accessing X for the first time

- All subsequent accesses are to the local copy

- After last access, transaction executes **write**(X)

<br>

**Output**(BX) does not need to follow **write**(X) immediately

<br>

# (2) Recovery and Atomicity 

**Inconsistent state**

- Modifying the DB, ***without ensuring that the transaction will commit*** may leave the database in an inconsistent state

<br>

Example )

- Transaction $$T_i$$ : transfers $$50 from account A to account B
- Goal : either to perform **"all"** DB modifications made by $$T_i$$ or **"none at all"**
- Several output operations may be required for $$T_i$$

$$\rightarrow$$ A failure may occur after **one of these modifications have been made** but **before all of them are made**

<br>

To ensure atomicity despite failures ...

$$\rightarrow$$ we first output information describing the modifications to **stable storage ** without modifying the DB itself

<br>

2 approaches

- (1) Log-based recovery
- (2) Shadow-paging

<br>

We assume (initially) that **transactions run serially**

<br>

# (3) Log-Based Recovery 

Log = sequence of log records

- records all the update activities in the DB

<br>

When transaction $$T_i$$  starts....

- (1) Registers itself by writing a <$$T_i$$ **start**> log record
- (2) Before $$T_i$$ executes **write**(X), a log record <$$T_i$$, X, V1, V2> is written
  - where V1 is an old value and V2 is a new value
- (3) When $$T_i$$ finishes its last statement, the log record <$$T_i$$ **commit**> is written

<br>

Assumption

- log records are written directly to **stable storage**

  ( = they are not buffered )

<br>

2 approaches using logs:

- (1) Deferred DB modification
- (2) **Immediate** DB modification

<br>

## a) Defered DB modification

records all DB modifications in the log, 

but defers all the **writes** until the transaction partially commits

<br>

- Transaction starts by writing <$$T_i$$ **start**> record to log

- A **write**(X) operation by $$T_i$$ results in the writing of a new record to the log

- The write is not performed on $$X$$ at this time, but deferred!!

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img116.png)

<br>

## b) Immediate DB modification

allows DB modifications to be output to the DB, while the transaction is still in the **active** stage

<br>

- Update log record must be written **before** DB item is written

- Output of updated buffer blocks can take place at any time before or after transaction commit

- Order in which blocks are output can be different from the order in which they are **written**

<br>

When recovering after failure:

- (1) Transaction $$T_i$$ needs to be UNDONE…

  if the log contains the record <$$T_i$$ **start**>, but does not contain the record <$$T_i$$ **commit**>

- (2) Transaction $$T_i$$ needs to be REDONE …

  if the log contains both the record <$$T_i$$ **start**> and the record <$$T_i$$ **commit**>

<br>

<br>

## c) Checkpoints

Problems in recovery procedure

- ***Searching the entire log is time-consuming***

- Most of the transactions that need to be redone ***have already written their updates*** into the DB

<br>

To reduce these types of overhead ….

$$\rightarrow$$ the system periodically performs **“checkpoints”**, which require the following sequence of actions :

- (1) Output onto stable storage “all **log records** currently residing in main memory“

- (2) Output to the disk “all modified buffer blocks“

- (3) Output onto stable storage “a log record <**checkpoint**>“

<br>

During recovery, we need to consider 

- (1) **only the MOST RECENT transaction $$T_i$$** that **started before the checkpoint**, and 
- (2) transactions **that started after $$T_i$$**

<br>

Procedure

- step 1) Scan backward from **end of log** to find the most recent <**checkpoint**> record

- step 2) **Continue scanning backwards** till a record <$$T_i$$ **start**> is found

- step 3) Need only consider the part of log “following above **start** record”

- step 4) 
  - 4-1) For all transactions starting from $$T_i$$ or later with no <$$T_i$$ **commit**>, execute **undo**($$T_i$$)
  - 4-2) Scanning forward in the log, for all transactions starting from $$T_i$$ or later with <$$T_i$$ **commit**>, execute **redo**($$T_i$$)

<br>

# (4) Shadow Paging

## a) Page & Page Table

DB is partitioned into some **number of fixed-length blocks** ( =  **pages** )

The pages do not need to be stored in any particular order on disk

***We use a “page table” to find the $$i$$th “page” of the DB for a given $$i$$***

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img119.png)

<br>

## b) Shadow Paging

Shadow Paging 

- alternative to log-based recovery
- useful if transactions execute serially

<br>

Key Idea : maintain **2 page tables** during the lifetime of a transaction

- page 1) **”current”** page table

- page 2) **”shadow”** page table

$$\rightarrow$$ Both page tables are identical when the transaction starts

<br>

Shadow Table

- never changed over the duration of the transaction

<br>

Current Page Table

- may be changed when a transaction performs a **write** operation

- All **input** and **output** operations use the **current page table** to locate database pages on disk

<br>

Suppose that $$T_j$$ performs a **write**($$X$$), and that $$X$$ resides on the $$i$$th page

The system executes the write operation as follows:

- If the $$i$$th page is not already in main memory

  $$\rightarrow$$ then the system issues **input**(X)

- If this is the write first performed on the $$i$$th page by this transaction, 

  $$\rightarrow$$ then the system modifies the current page table as follows:

  - (1) It **finds an unused page** on disk
  - (2) It copies the contents of the **$$i$$th page to the page found** in above step
  - (3) It **modifies the current page table** so that the $$i$$th entry points to the page found in above step

- It assigns the value of $$x_j$$ to $$X$$ in the buffer page

# (5) Recovery with Concurrent Transactions

modify the log-based recovery schemes,

to allow **MULTIPLE transactions to execute CONCURRENTLY**

( = **share** a "single buffer" and a "single log" )

<br>

**Checkpoint** technique & actions taken on **recovery** have to be changed

<br>

### Review

- **UNDO-list**  = consists of **incomplete** transactions that **must be undone**

- **REDO-list**  = consists of **finished** transactions that **must be redone**

<br>

### Checkpoint

checkpoint log record : <**checkpoint** L>

- L : list of transactions active at the time of checkpoint

<br>

Procedures

- step 1) Initialize **undo-list** and **redo-list** to empty

- step 2) Scan the log **backward** from the end

  & stop when the first <**checkpoint** L> record is found

- step 3) For each record found during the backward scan:
  - if the record is <Ti **commit**> $\rightarrow$ add Ti to **REDO-list**;
  - If the record is <Ti **start**> & not in **redo-list** $\rightarrow$ add Ti to **undo-list**

- step 4) For every Ti in L ...
  - if Ti is not in **redo-list** $\rightarrow$ add Ti to **UNDO-list**

<br>

### Recovery

Procedures

- step 1) Scan log **backward** from the end

  & perform **UNDO** for each log record in Ti on **UNDO-list**

  & stop  when <Ti **start**> records have been found for every Ti in **undo-list**

- step 2) Locate the most recent <**checkpoint** L> record

- step 3) Scan log **forward** from the <**checkpoint** L> record

  & perform **REDO** for each log record in Ti on **REDO-list**

<br>

[ Caution ] first UNDO, then REDO!

<br>

# (6) Buffer Management

### Log Record Buffering

Log records 

- buffered in **"main memory** ( not directly to stable storage )

- output to stable storage,  when ... 

  - (1) block of log records in the buffer is full, 

  - (2)  **log force** operation is executed

    - ***log force*** : performed to commit a transaction by forcing all its log records to stable storage

      ( Several log records can be output using a single output operation, reducing the I/O cost )

<br>

Rules ( if log records are buffered )

- Log records are output to **stable storage** in the order **in which they are CREATED**

- Ti enters the commit state,

  only when the log record <Ti **commit**> has been output to stable storage

- [ **write-ahead logging** or **WAL** rule ] : 

  - Before a **block of data** in main memory is output to the DB,  

    **all log records pertaining to data IN THAT BLOCK** must have been output to stable storage
