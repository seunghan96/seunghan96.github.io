# 0. Abstract

- 1) transform TS to "Recurrence Plots"
- 2) extract features from Recurrence Plots
- 3) extracted features are used for "Forecast Model Averaging"

<br>

# 1. Introduction

- TS clustering
- TS classification

- Anomaly detection

$$\rightarrow$$ quantification of "SIMILARITY among TS data" 

<br>

1) most of existing approaches depend on manual choice

2) current literature on feature-based forecasting focuses on "global" features, not "local"

$$\rightarrow$$ automated feature extraction becomes vital

<br>

Sections

- Section 2 : feature extraction from image

- Section 3 : how to assign weights to a group of forecasting methods ( using image features )

- Section 4 : application
