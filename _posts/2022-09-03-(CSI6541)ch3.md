# Chapter 3. Introduction to SQL

### (1) SQL의 분류

**DDL (Definition) : 데이터 정의어**

- schema를 정의/수정/삭제
  - CREATE TABLE
  - ALTER TABLE
  - DROP TABLE

<br>

**DML (Manipulation) : 데이터 조작어**

- data의 삽입/삭제/수정/검색 등
  - SELECT
  - INSERT
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE

<br>

**DCL (Control) : 데이터 제어어**

- 내부적으로 필요한 규칙/기법을 정의하기 위해
  - GRANT (권한 부여)
  - REVOKE (권한 취소)

<br>

### (2) Domain Types in SQL

- **char(n)**: Fixed length character string, with user-specified length n

- **varchar(n)**: Variable length character string, with user-specified maximum length n

- **int**: Integer (machine-dependent)

- **smallint**: Small integer (machine-dependent)

- **numeric(p,d)**: Fixed pointer number, with user-specified precision of p digits, with d digits to the right of decimal point

- **real, double precision**: Floating point and double-precision floating point numbers (machine-dependent)

<br>

### (3) CREATE TABLE

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img9.png)

<br>

***integrity-constraint***

- NOT NULL

- PRIMARY KEY ($A_1, \cdots A_n$)

  ( automatically ensures **NOT NULL** )

- FOREIGN KEY ($A_1, \cdots A_n$) REFERENCES $r$

<br>

other examples )

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img10.png)

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img11.png)

<br>

***참조 무결성 제약조건***

- foreign key(외래 키)를 통해 관계를 맺고 있는 2개의 테이블의 경우!

<br>

### (4) Updates to Tables

```sql
INSERT INTO instructor VALUES (‘10211’, ‘Smith’, ‘Biology’, 66000);

DELETE FROM student;

DROP TABLE r;

ALTER TABLE r ADD A D;

ALTER TABLE r DROP A;
```

<br>

## (5) Basic Query Structure

```sql
SELECT A1, A2, ..., An
FROM r1, r2, ..., rm
WHERE P
```

<br>

to eliminate/keep duplicates ...

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT dept_name
FROM instructure

SELECT ALL dept_name
FROM instructure
```

<br>

to rename...

- AS can be ommited!

```sql
SELECT ID, name, salary/12 AS monthly_salary;
FROM instructor
```

<br>

Where Clause

```sql
# AND, OR, NOT, IN, NOT IN ...
WHERE dept_name = ‘Comp. Sci.’ AND salary > 80000
```

<br>

Order by

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM instructor
ORDER BY name
```



Examples )

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary BETWEEN 90000 AND 100000
```

```sql
# tuple comparison
SELECT name, course_id
FROM instructor, teaches
WHERE (instructor.ID, dept_name) = (teaches.ID, ‘Biology’)
```

```sql
SELECT name, course_id
FROM instructor, teaches
WHERE instructor.ID = teaches.ID AND instructor.dept_name = ‘Art’
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T.name 
FROM instructor AS T, instructor AS S  
WHERE T.salary > S.salary AND S.dept_name = ‘Comp. Sci.’;
```

<br>

### (6) String Operations

string-matching operator : **like**

- uses patterns, that are described using...
  - (1) `%` : matches any substring
  - (2) `_` : matches any character

<br>

Example ) whose name includes `dar`

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE name LIKE '%dar%'
```

<br>

### (7) Set Operations

```
(~) UNION (~)
(~) INTERSECT (~)
(~) EXCEPT (~)
```

<br>

to retain dupliactes...

```
(~) UNION ALL (~)
(~) INTERSECT ALL (~)
(~) EXCEPT ALL (~)
```

<br>

### (8) Null values

```
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary IS NULL
```

<br>

### (9) Aggregate functions

- avg, min, max, sum, count

<br>

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM course

SELECT avg(salary)
FROM instructor
WHERE dept_name = ‘Comp. Sci.’


SELECT count(distinct ID)
FROM teaches
WHERE semester = ‘Spring’ AND year = 2010
```

<br>

### (10) Aggregate functions + Group By

```sql
SELECT dept_name, avg(salary)
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING avg(salary) > 42000
```

<br>

<br>

### (11) ORDER of EXECUTION !!

SQL : **non-procedural** language ( 비절차적인 언어 )

( but, have execution order! )

F W G H C O

<br>

Example

$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { SELECT } & \text { custid, COUNT(*) AS 도서수량 } \\
\text { FROM } & \text { Orders } \\
\text { WHERE } & \text { saleprice }>=8000 \\
\text { GROUP BY } & \text { custid } \\
\text { HAVING } & \text { count }\left(^*\right)>1 \\
\text { ORDER BY } & \text { custid; }
\end{array}\begin{array}{ll}
\end{array}$

- step 1) FROM
- step 2) WHERE
- step 3) GROUP BY
- step 4) HAVING
- step 5) COUNT
- step 6) ORDER BY

<br>

### (12) Null values & Aggregate

```sql
SELECT sum(salary)
FROM instructor
```

- **ignores null** amounts
- all aggregation operations, except "`count(*)`", ignore null values!

<br>

### (13) Nested Subqueries

subquery : **SELECT - FROM - WHERE** expression, that is nested within another query

```sql
select distinct course_id 
from section 
where semester = ‘Fall’ 
 and year = 2009 
 and course_id not in (
    select course_id   
    from section   
    where semester = ‘Spring’ 
     and year = 2010);
```

<br>

### (14) Set Comparison

**some** clause

ex) salary greater than that of some **(at least one)** instructor ~

- version 1) w.o **some**

  ```sql
  select distinct T.name 
  from instructor as T, 
   instructor as S 
  where T.salary > S.salary 
   and S.dept_name = ‘Biology’
  ```

- version 2) with **some**

  ```sql
  select name 
  from instructor 
  where salary > some (select salary   
                       from instructor   
                       where dept_name = ‘Biology’);
  ```

<br>

**all** clause

ex) salary greater than **all of** ~

```sql
select name 
from instructor 
where salary > all (select salary   
                    from instructor   
                    where dept_name = ‘Biology’);
```

<br>

### (15) Test for Empty Relations

- exists
- not exists

<br>

ex) “Find all courses taught **both in Fall 2009 and in Spring 2010**”

```sql
select course_id 
from section as S 
where semester = ‘Fall’ 
 and year = 2009 
 and exists (select *   
              from section as T   
              where semester = ‘Spring’ 
               and year = 2010    
               and S.course_id = T.course_id);
```

<br>

ex) Find all students who have taken all courses offered in the Biology department

```sql
select distinct S.ID, S.name 
from student as S 
where not exists (
  (select course_id   
   from course   
   where dept_name = ‘Biology’ )
  except  
  (select T.course_id
   from takes as T
   where S.ID = T.ID));          
```

<br>

### (16) Test for absence of duplicate tuples

**unique**

- tests whether a subqery has any duplicate tuples in the result
- TRUE, if no duplciates

<br>

ex) Find all courses that were offered at most once in 2009

```sql
select T.course_id 
from course as T 
where unique (select R.course_id   
              from section as R   
              where T.course_id = R.course_id 
              	and R.year = 2009);
```

<br>

### (17) Database Modification

**[ Delete ]**

ex) Delete all instructors from the Finance dept

```sql
delete from	instructor 
where	dept_name = ‘Finance’
```

<br>

ex) Delete all instructors **whose salary is less than the average salary of instructors**

```sql
delete from	instructor 
where	salary < (select avg (salary) 
                from instructor)
```

<br>

**[ Insert ]**

ex) Add a new tuple to course:

```sql
insert into course
values (‘CS-437’, ‘Database Systems’, ‘Comp. Sci’, 4);
```

```sql
insert into course (course_id, title, credits, dept_name)
values (‘CS-437’, ‘Database Systems’, 4, ‘Comp. Sci’);
```

<br>

ex) Add all instructors to the student relation with tot_creds set to 0

```sql
insert into	student
	select	ID, name,  dept_name, 0
	from	instructor
```

<br>

**[ Update ]**

ex) Increase salaries of instructors whose salary is over $100,000 by 3% and all others receive 5% raise:

```sql
update	instructor
set	salary = salary * 1.03
where	salary > 100000;

update	instructor
set	salary = salary * 1.05
where	salary <= 100000;
```

<br>

( Can be done better using the **case** statement )

```sql
update	instructor
set	salary =
	case
		when salary <= 100000 then salary *1.05
    else salary * 1.03
  end ;
```
