# CVPR 2023 Reviewer Guidelines



## (1) Reviewing In a Nutshell

- embrace **novel, brave concepts**, even if they have not been tested on many datasets. 

- instead of SOTA ...important to weigh both the **novelty and potential impact of the work** 

- **Minor flaws that can be easily corrected should not be a reason to reject a paper.**

<br>

## (2) Ethics for Reviewing Papers

1. Respect anonymity in the review process

2. Protect Ideas

3. Avoid Conflicts of Interest

4. Be Professional

<br>

## (3) How to Write Good Reviews

- Take the time to write good reviews.
- Short reviews are unhelpful to authors, other reviewers, and Area Chairs. 
- Be specific when you suggest that the writing needs to be improved.
- Be specific about novelty. 
- Do not reject papers solely because they are missing citations or comparisons to prior work that has only been published without review
- Do not give away your identity by asking the authors to cite several of your own papers.
- If you think the paper is out of scope for CVPR's subject areas, clearly explain why in the review. 
- The tone of your review is important. A harshly written review will be resented by the authors, regardless of whether your criticisms are true. 
- Avoid referring to the authors in the second person (“you”). It is best to avoid the term “the authors” as well, because you are reviewing their work and not the person. Instead, use the third person (“the paper”). 
- Be generous about giving the authors new ideas for how they can improve their work.
- Please refer to the [Ethics Guidelines](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/Conferences/2023/EthicsGuidelines) and [Suggested Practices for Authors](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/Conferences/2023/AuthorSuggestedPractices) page to find out how to handle a some specific issues that may arise.



### Reviewer FAQs

*Q. Is there a minimum number of papers I should accept or reject?*

- A. No

*Q. Can I review a paper I already saw on arXiv and hence know who the authors are?*

- A. In general, yes, unless you are conflicted with one of the authors.

*Q. How should I treat papers for which I know the authors?*

- A. Reviewers should make every effort to treat each paper impartially, whether or not they know who wrote the paper

*Q. There are well-established conferences with a rigorous peer review process, like ICIP and ICASSP, that publish proceedings with four-page papers. Suppose that a reviewer identifies a prior ICASSP or ICIP paper that has substantial overlap with a CVPR submission. Should this ICASSP/ICIP* *paper not be considered a "previous publication" under the CVPR'23 Dual Submission policy?*

- A. If the prior paper is within four pages, the CVPR submission in question is not in violation of the Dual Submission policy and will not be administratively rejected. However, the reviewer still needs to use their judgment to determine **whether the submission offers enough additional value** to warrant acceptance at CVPR. 

*Q. Should authors be expected to cite related arXiv papers or compare to their results?*

- A. Consistent with good academic practice, the authors should cite all sources that inspired and informed their work. This said, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work with arXiv reports that appeared shortly before the submission deadline imposes an unreasonable burden. We also do not wish to discourage the publication of similar ideas that have been developed independently and concurrently. Reviewers should keep the following guidelines in mind:

  - Authors are not required to discuss and compare their work with recent arXiv reports, although they should properly acknowledge those that directly and obviously inspired them.

  - Failing to cite an arXiv paper or failing to beat its performance SHOULD NOT be SOLE grounds for rejection.

  - Reviewers SHOULD NOT reject a paper solely because another paper with a similar idea has already appeared on arXiv. If the reviewer suspects plagiarism or academic dishonesty, they are encouraged to bring these concerns to the attention of the Program Chairs.

  - It is acceptable for a reviewer to suggest that an author should acknowledge or be aware of something on arXiv.


*Q. How should I treat the supplementary material?*

- The supplementary material is intended to provide details of derivations and results that do not fit within the paper format or space limit. 
- supplementary material MAY NOT include results obtained with an improved version of the method (e.g., following additional parameter tuning or training)
