<br>

Traditional ML Pipeline

- design "**node** features","**link** features","**graph** features"

  ( traditional method : "hand-designed" features )

- 2 steps

  - Step 1 : train an ML model

  - Step 2 : apply the model

( will focus on **undirected** graphs for simplicity )

<br>

Goal : make **"prediction" for node/link/graph**

Design choices

- features : $$d$$-dim vector
- objects : node / edge / set of nodes / graph
- objective functions 

<br>

# 2-1. Traditional Feature-based Methods : Node

## 1) Node-level tasks

ex) **Node classification**

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img19.png)

<br>

Goal : characterize "node" in structure

- 1) **node degree**
- 2) **node centrality**
- 3) **clustering coefficient**
- 4) **graphlets**

<br>

## 1) Node Degree

- $$k_v$$ : number of edges in node $$v$$
- simple, but very useful feature!
- treat all neighbors equally

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img20.png)

<br>

## 2) Node Centrality

Problems of node degree :

- do not consider **nodes' importance**

  ***$$\rightarrow$$ use "Node Centrality"***

<br>

**Node centrality**

- $$c_v$$: importance of node  $$v$$ in a graph
- example
  - 1) **eigenvector** centrality
  - 2) **betweenness** ~
  - 3) **closeness** ~

<br>

### (a) Eigenvector centrality

important, if it is ***surrounded by important nodes*** 

$$c_{v}=\frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{u \in N(v)} c_{u}$$ $$\leftrightarrow$$ $$\lambda c = Ac$$

- $$\lambda$$ : positive constant
- $$A$$ : adjacency matrix
- $$c$$ : centrality vector

leading eigenvector $$c_{max}$$ is used for centrality

<br>

### (b) Betweenness centrality

important, if it ***lies in the shortest path between 2 nodes*** 

$$c_{v}=\sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\#(\text { shortest paths betwen } s \text { and } t \text { that contain } v)}{\#(\text { shortest paths between } s \text { and } t)}$$.

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img21.png)

<br>

### (c) Closeness centrality

important, if it ***has small shortest path lengths to all other nodes***

$$c_{v}=\frac{1}{\sum_{u \neq v} \text { shortest path length between } u \text { and } v}$$.

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img22.png)

<br>

## 3) Clustering Coefficients

measure **how connected node $$v$$'s NEIGHBORS** are!

$$e_{v}=\frac{\#(\text { edges among neighboring nodes })}{\left(\begin{array}{c}
k_{v} \\
2
\end{array}\right)} \in[0,1]$$.

- $$\left(\begin{array}{c}
  k_{v} \\
  2
  \end{array}\right)$$ : \# of node pairs, among $$k_v$$ neighboring nodes

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img23.png)

<br>

## 4) Graphlets

**clustering coefficients :**

- count the \# of triangles in the ego-network

<br>

$$\rightarrow$$ generalize, by counting **graphlets**

( graphlets : rooted connected **non-isomorphic subgraphs** )

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img24.png)

<br>

Definition

- **GDV (Graphlet Degree Vector) :**
  - graphlet-base features for nodes
  - **\# of graphlets** that node touches
- **Degree : **
  - **\# of edges** that node touches
- **Clustering Coefficients**
  - **\# of triangles** that node touches

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img25.png)

<br>

### Summary

- importance-based features :
  - **1) node degree**
  - **2) node centrality measures**
    - eigenvector / betweenness / closeness centrality
- structure-based features :
  - **1) node degree**
  - **2) clustering coefficients**
    - how connected neighbors are to each other
  - **3) graphlet degree vector**
    - occurences of different graphlets

<br>

# 2-2. Traditional Feature-based Methods : Link

predict "new links"

( whether 2 nodes are connected! )

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img26.png)

<br>

Key point : ***how to design features for PAIR OF NODES***

<br>

## 1) Two formulations of **link prediction**

- **1) Links Missing At Random**

  - step 1) remove random set of links
  - step 2) predict them

- **2) Links over time**

  - network that changes over time!

  - **input : $$G[t_0, t_0']$$**

    ( = graphs, up to time $$t_o'$$ )

  - **output : ranked list $$L$$ of links**

    ( that are not in $$G[t_0, t_0']$$, but is predicted to appear in $$G[t_1, t_1']$$ )

<br>

## 2) Link prediction, via Proximity

notation

- pair of nodes : $$(x,y)$$
- score of $$(x,y)$$ : $$c(x,y)$$
  - ex) \# of common neighbors of $$x$$ and $$y$$

<br>

Step 1) Sort "pair of nodes", **by their "score" ( decreasing order )**

Step 2) **Predict top $$n$$ pairs**, as new links

<br>

## 3) Link feature

- **distance-based** feature
- **local** neighborhood overlap
- **global** neighborhood overlap

<br>

### (a) distance based feature

- **shortest-path distance** between 2 nodes
- problem
  - does not capture "degree of neighborhood of **overlap**"  

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img27.png)

<br>

### (b) local neighborhood overlap

- **\# of neighboring nodes**, shared between 2 nodes
- example
  - 1) **common neighbors** : $$ \mid N\left(v_{1}\right) \cap N\left(v_{2}\right) \mid $$
  - 2) **Jaccard's coefficient** : $$\frac{ \mid N\left(v_{1}\right) \cap N\left(v_{2}\right) \mid }{ \mid N\left(v_{1}\right) \cup N\left(v_{2}\right) \mid }$$
  - 3) **Adamic-Adar index** : $$\sum_{u \in N\left(v_{1}\right) \cap N\left(v_{2}\right)} \frac{1}{\log \left(k_{u}\right)}$$
    - $$k_u$$ : degree of node $$u$$
    - consider neighbor's importance by its degree

<br>

Limitation :

- zero, when 2 nodes don't share any nodes

  ( but may have potential to be connected! )

- thus, use **GLOBAL neighborhood overlap**

  ( by considering "ENTIRE" graph )

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img28.png)

<br>

### (c) global neighborhood overlap

(intro) Katz index

- **\# of paths of all lengths** between 2 nodes
- how? by calculating **"Powers of graph Adjacency Matrix"**
- Theory
  - $$\boldsymbol{P}_{u v}^{(K)}$$ = \# of paths of length $$\boldsymbol{K}$$ between $$\boldsymbol{u}$$ and $$\boldsymbol{v}$$ 
  - $$P^{(K)}=A^{k}$$.
- ex) $$A^2_{uv}$$ : \# of paths of length 2, between $$u$$ & $$v$$

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img29.png)

<br>

**Katz index**

- sum over all path lengths

- $$S_{v_{1} v_{2}}=\sum_{l=1}^{\infty} \beta^{l} \boldsymbol{A}_{v_{1} v_{2}}^{l}$$.
  - $$\beta$$ : discount factor 
  - $$\boldsymbol{A}_{v_{1} v_{2}}^{l}$$ : \# paths of length $$l$$, between $$v_1$$ & $$v_2$$
- closed form solution :
  - $$\boldsymbol{S}=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \beta^{i} \boldsymbol{A}^{i}=\underbrace{(\boldsymbol{I}-\beta \boldsymbol{A})^{-1}}_{=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{i} A^{i}}-\boldsymbol{I}$$.

<br>

# 2-3. Traditional Feature-based Methods : Graph

Goal : want feature that considers **structure of ENTIRE GRAPH**

$$\rightarrow$$ use **Kernel Methods**

<br>

## 1) Kernel Methods

Key Idea : 

- design **"kernels"**, instead of "feature vectors"

<br>

Kernel & Kernel matrix

- **kernel** $$K(G,G')$$ : similarity between data
  - $$K(G,G') = \phi(G)^T\phi(G')$$ 
- **kernel matrix** $$K=(K(G,G'))_{G,G'}$$ : positive semi-definite

<br>

## 2) Graph kernels

measures similarity between 2 graphs

- 1) **Graphlet** Kernel
- 2) **Weisfeiler-Lehman** Kernel

<br>

Goal : design graph feature vector $$\phi(G)$$

Key Idea : BoW( + $$\alpha$$ ) for a graph

<br>

**(1) simple version : Bag-of-Words**

- just treat node as words

- example )

  ![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img30.png)

<br>

**(2) Bag-of-"Node degrees"**

- example )

  ![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img31.png)

<br>

Graphlet Kernel & Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel 

$$\rightarrow$$ both uses **"Bag-of-xx"** concept!

<br>

## 3) Graphlet Kernel

- **\# of different graphlets** in a graph
- Node-level vs **Graph-level**
  - **(1) do not need to be connected**
  - **(2) are not rooted**
  - example)

<br>

Notation

- $$G$$ : graph
- $$G_k = (g_1,..,g_{n_k})$$ : graphlet list
- $$f_g \in R^{n_k}$$ : graphlet count vector
  - $$\left(\boldsymbol{f}_{G}\right)_{i}=\#\left(g_{i} \subseteq G\right) \text { for } i=1,2, \ldots, n_{k}$$.
- $$K(G,G') = f_G^T f_{G'}$$ : graphlet kernel
- ![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img32.png)

<br>

Problem

- if size of $$G$$ & $$G'$$ is different.... skew the value

<br>

Solution

- normalize each feature vector
- $$K\left(G, G^{\prime}\right)=\boldsymbol{h}_{G}{ }^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{h}_{G^{\prime}}$$.
  - where $$\boldsymbol{h}_{G}=\frac{\boldsymbol{f}_{G}}{\operatorname{Sum}\left(\boldsymbol{f}_{G}\right)}$$.

<br>

Limitation

- too expensive to count graphlets!

- how to design more efficient kernel?

  $$\rightarrow$$ **Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel**

<br>



## 4) Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel 

Goal : 

- design an "**EFFICIENT**" graph feature descriptor $$\phi(G)$$

<br>

Key Idea

- use **neighborhood structure** to **iteratively** enrich node vocabulary
- ( = generalized version of **Bag of "node-degrees"** )

<br>

Algorithm : ***COLOR REFINEMENT***

<br>

### Color Refinement

- (notation) graph $$G$$ with nodes $$V$$

- process

  - step 1) assign initial color $$c^{(0)}(v)$$ to each node $$v$$

  - step 2) iteratively refine node colors.....

    - $$C^{(k+1)}(v)=\operatorname{HASH}\left(\left\{C^{(k)}(v),\left\{C^{(k)}(u)\right\}_{u \in N(v)}\right\}\right)$$.

    - HASH : mapping function

      ( different input to different color )

  - ....

  - after $$K$$ steps of color refinement,

    $$c^{(K)}(v)$$ : **structure of $$K$$-hop neighborhood**

## 5) Summary of graph kernels

### Graphlet Kernel

- summary
  - graph = ***"bag of GRAPHLETS"***
- disadvantage
  - computationally **expensive**

<br>

### Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel 

- summary
  - apply $$K$$-step color refinement
  - graph = ***"bag-of-COLORS"***
  - closely related to GNN

- advantages
  - computationally **efficient**

  - only colors need to be tracked

    $$\rightarrow$$ \# of colors : at most \# of nodes

  - **time complexity : linear in \# of edges**

<br>
