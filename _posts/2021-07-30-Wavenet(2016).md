# 0. Abstract

Wavenet : DNN for generating raw audio waveforms

- **fully probabilistic**
- **autoregressive**

<br>

# 1. WaveNet

- introduce new generative model

- joint probability of waveform $$\mathbf{x}=\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{T}\right\}$$ :

  **factorized** as ... 

  $$p(\mathbf{x})=\prod_{t=1}^{T} p\left(x_{t} \mid x_{1}, \ldots, x_{t-1}\right)$$.

- similar to PixelCNNs, the conditional prob dist is modelled by **a stack of CONVOLUTIONAL layers**

- outputs a **categorical distn** over the next $$x_t$$ with softmax layer

- optimized to **maximize log likelihood**

## (1) Dilated Causal Convolutions

key of WaveNet : ***"casual convolutions"***

- **ensure "time ordering"** ( = no cheating )

  ( $$\approx$$ masked convolution for CNN )

- for 1D data (ex. audio), **easy to implement**

  ( just shift the output of normal convolution by a few timestep )

<br>

Train & Inference

- [ Train ] : can be made in **parallel** ( all KNOWN )

  $$\rightarrow$$ faster than RNN

- [ INFERENCE ] : made **sequentially** 

<br>

**Problem : require many layers**

$$\rightarrow$$ use **dilated convolutions** to increase receptive field! ( w.o increasing computational cost )

<br>

### Dilated Convolution

- use "skipping" for "efficieincy"

- similar to pooling / strided convolutions

  ( BUT, difference : output has the SAME size as the input )
