# A Review on Outlier/Anomaly Detection in TS data

<br>

## Contents

1. Introduction



# 1. Introduction

Two types of outliers in UTS

- (1) type 1 : affects a single observation
- (2) type 2 : affects both a particular observation and the subsequent observations. 

$\rightarrow$ Extended to 4 outlier types & to the case of MTS

<br>

Many definitions of the term outlier. However still no consensus on the terms 

- ex) outlier observations = anomalies, discordant observations, discords, exceptions, aberrations, surprises, peculiarities or contaminants.

<br>

***Classical Definition***

â€œAn observation which **deviates so much** from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a **different mechanism.**" 

<br>

Outliers in TS can have 2 different meanings ( based on the interest of the analyst )

<br>

( Recent years ) aim to detect & analyze unusual but interesting phenomena. 

- ex) Fraud detection => main objective is to detect and analyze the outlier itself. 

  $\rightarrow$ often referred to as **anomalies**

<br>

Section Intro

- Section 2 ) **taxonomy for the classification of outlier detection** techniques in TS
- Section 3 ~ 5 ) different techniques used for **point, subsequence, and time series** outlier detection

# 2. Taxonomy of Outlier Detection Techniques in the TS context

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img384.png)

Outlier detection techniques 

- vary depending on the **(1) input data type**, the **(2) outlier type**, and the **(3) nature of the method** 

<br>

## (1) Input Data

1. UTS : $X=\left\{x_t\right\}_{t \in T}$ 
   - recorded at a specific time $t \in T \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
   - $x_t$ : point or observation collected at time $t$ 
   - $S=x_p, x_{p+1}, \ldots, x_{p+n-1}$ : subsequence of length $n \leq|T|$ 
   - assumed that $x_t$ is a realized value of a certain r.v $X_t$. 

<br>

2. MTS : $\boldsymbol{X}=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\right\}_{t \in T}$ 

- ordered set of $k$ dim-vectors
- recorded at a specific time $t \in T \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
- consists of $k$ real-valued observations, $\boldsymbol{x}_t=\left(x_{1 t}, \ldots, x_{k t}\right)^1$

- $S=x_p, x_{p+1}, \ldots, x_{p+n-1}$ : subsequence of length $n \leq|T|$ of $X$, 
- $X_t=\left(X_{1 t}, \ldots, X_{k t}\right)$.

<br>

## (2) Outlier Type

1. Point outliers.

   - behaves unusually in a specific time instant, when compared either ...
     - (1) to the other values in the time series (global outlier)
     - (2) to its neighboring points (local outlier). 
   - can be univariate or multivariate
     - depending on whether they affect one or more time-dependent variables

   - example) Fig 3a

<br>

2. Subsequence outliers. 
   - consecutive points in time 
   - joint behavior is unusual ( although each observation individually is not necessarily a point outlier )
   - can also be global or local
   - can affect one (univariate subsequence outlier) or more (multivariate subsequence outlier) time-dependent variables

<br>

3. Outlier Time Series

-  Entire time series can also be outliers

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img387.png)

<br>

Summary

- closely related to the input data type

  - ex) If the method only allows UTS as input, then no multivariate point or subsequence outliers can be identified. 

- outlier time series can only be found in MTS

- outliers depend on the context

  - ex)  If the detection method uses the entire TS as contextual information

    $\rightarrow$ then the detected outliers are global. 

  - ex) If the method only uses a segment of the series (a time window)

    $\rightarrow$  then the detected outliers are local 

    ( because they are outliers within their neighborhood )

- global outliers are also local, but not all local outliers are global. (e.g., O1 in Fig. 3a).

<br>

## (3) Nature of the method

Nature of the detection method employed

<br>

Univariate detection method 

- only considers a single time-dependent variable

Multivariate detection method 

- able to simultaneously work with more than one time-dependent variable. 

<br>

Detection method can be univariate, even if the input data is MTS

( = individual analysis can be performed on each time-dependent variable )

Multivariate technique cannot be used if the input data is UTS
