# 1. Introduction

Two types of outliers in UTS

- (1) type 1 : affects a single observation
- (2) type 2 : affects both a particular observation and the subsequent observations. 

$\rightarrow$ Extended to 4 outlier types & to the case of MTS

<br>

Many definitions of the term outlier. However still no consensus on the terms 

- ex) outlier observations = anomalies, discordant observations, discords, exceptions, aberrations, surprises, peculiarities or contaminants.

<br>

***Classical Definition***

â€œAn observation which **deviates so much** from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a **different mechanism.**" 

<br>

Outliers in TS can have 2 different meanings ( based on the interest of the analyst )

<br>

( Recent years ) aim to detect & analyze unusual but interesting phenomena. 

- ex) Fraud detection => main objective is to detect and analyze the outlier itself. 

  $\rightarrow$ often referred to as **anomalies**

<br>

Section Intro

- Section 2 ) **taxonomy for the classification of outlier detection** techniques in TS
- Section 3 ~ 5 ) different techniques used for **point, subsequence, and time series** outlier detection

<br>

# 2. Taxonomy of Outlier Detection Techniques in the TS context

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img384.png)

Outlier detection techniques 

- vary depending on the **(1) input data type**, the **(2) outlier type**, and the **(3) nature of the method** 

<br>

## (1) Input Data

1. UTS : $X=\left\{x_t\right\}_{t \in T}$ 
   - recorded at a specific time $t \in T \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
   - $x_t$ : point or observation collected at time $t$ 
   - $S=x_p, x_{p+1}, \ldots, x_{p+n-1}$ : subsequence of length $n \leq \mid T \mid $ 
   - assumed that $x_t$ is a realized value of a certain r.v $X_t$. 

<br>

2. MTS : $\boldsymbol{X}=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\right\}_{t \in T}$ 

- ordered set of $k$ dim-vectors
- recorded at a specific time $t \in T \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
- consists of $k$ real-valued observations, $\boldsymbol{x}_t=\left(x_{1 t}, \ldots, x_{k t}\right)^1$

- $S=x_p, x_{p+1}, \ldots, x_{p+n-1}$ : subsequence of length $n \leq \mid T \mid $ of $X$, 
- $X_t=\left(X_{1 t}, \ldots, X_{k t}\right)$.

<br>

## (2) Outlier Type

1. Point outliers.

   - behaves unusually in a specific time instant, when compared either ...
     - (1) to the other values in the time series (global outlier)
     - (2) to its neighboring points (local outlier). 
   - can be univariate or multivariate
     - depending on whether they affect one or more time-dependent variables

   - example) Fig 3a

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img385.png)

<br>

2. Subsequence outliers. 
   - consecutive points in time 
   - joint behavior is unusual ( although each observation individually is not necessarily a point outlier )
   - can also be global or local
   - can affect one (univariate subsequence outlier) or more (multivariate subsequence outlier) time-dependent variables

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img386.png)

<br>

3. Outlier Time Series

-  Entire time series can also be outliers

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img387.png)

<br>

Summary

- closely related to the input data type

  - ex) If the method only allows UTS as input, then no multivariate point or subsequence outliers can be identified. 

- outlier time series can only be found in MTS

- outliers depend on the context

  - ex)  If the detection method uses the entire TS as contextual information

    $\rightarrow$ then the detected outliers are global. 

  - ex) If the method only uses a segment of the series (a time window)

    $\rightarrow$  then the detected outliers are local 

    ( because they are outliers within their neighborhood )

- global outliers are also local, but not all local outliers are global. (e.g., O1 in Fig. 3a).

<br>

## (3) Nature of the method

Nature of the detection method employed

<br>

Univariate detection method 

- only considers a single time-dependent variable

Multivariate detection method 

- able to simultaneously work with more than one time-dependent variable. 

<br>

Detection method can be univariate, even if the input data is MTS

( = individual analysis can be performed on each time-dependent variable )

Multivariate technique cannot be used if the input data is UTS

<br>

# 3. Point Outliers

Both in UTS & MTS

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img388.png)

2 key characteristics

- Temporality
  - whether it considers the inherent temporal order of the observations
    - (O) produce the different results if they are applied to a shuffled version of TS
    - (X) produce the same results if they are applied to a shuffled version of TS

- Streaming & Non-streaming
  - ability to detect outliers in streaming TS  ( = without having to wait for more data )

<br>

## (1) UTS

 detect point outliers in a UTS

- single time-dependent variable
- outliers = univariate points
- Only univariate detection techniques can be used

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img389.png)

<br>

***Point Outlier*** = point that significantly deviates from its expectve value

$ \mid x_t-\hat{x}_t \mid >\tau$.

- $x_t$ : observed
- $\hat{x}_t$ : expected

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img390.png)

<br>

### 1-a) Model-based methods

- $ \mid x_t-\hat{x}_t \mid >\tau$.
- most common approaches 
  - each technique computes $\hat{x}_t$ and $\tau$ differently
  - common ) based on fitting a model (either explicitly or implicitly). 

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img391.png)

<br>

(1) Estimation model-based methods

- $\hat{x}_t$ is obtained using previous and subsequent observations to $x_t$ **(past, current, and future data)**

(2) Prediction model-based methods

- $\hat{x}_t$ is obtained relying only on previous observations to $x_t$ **(past data)**

<br>

Main difference ?

- Prediction methods : can be used in streaming TS
  - can determine whether or not a new datum is an outlier as soon as it arrives. 
- Estimation methods : 
  - can only be done if, in addition to some points preceding / current point $x_t$ is used to compute

<br>

### Example) Estimation based

Example 1) constant or piecewise constant models

- use basic statistics ( ex. median, Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) ) to obtain $\hat{x_t}$
- calculated using the full TS or by grouping the TSin equal-length segments
- cannot be applied in streaming when future data is needed (k2 > 0). 

<br>

Example 2) unequal-length segments 

- obtained with a segmentation technique
- ex) use the mean of each segment to determine the expected value
- ex) adaptive threshold $\tau_i=\alpha \sigma_i$
  - $\alpha$ : fixed value
  - $\sigma_i$ : std of segment $i$
  - $\alpha$ is a fixed value and $\sigma_i$ the standard deviation of segment $i$.

<br>

Example 3) 

- identify data points that are unlikely if a certain fitted model or distribution is assumed to have generated the data
- ex) model the structure of the data
  - smoothing methods  ( B-splines, kernels, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) )
  - slope constraints
  - assume that the data are approximately normal
  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
- Once a model or distribution is assumed, use equation (1) directly to decid

<br>

### Example) Prediction based

- fit a model to the TS & obtain $\hat{x_t}$ using only PAST data

- deal with streaming TS

<br>

(A) Do not adapt to change

( = use a fixed model & not able to adapt to the changes that occur over time )

- ex) DeepAnT

  - deep learning-based outlier detection approach (CNN)

- ex) Autoregressive model / ARIMA model

  - obtain confidence intervals for the predictions instead of only point estimates.

  $\rightarrow$ implicitly define $\tau$

<br>

(B) Adapt to change

( = by retraining the model )

- ex) predicts the value $\hat{x_t}$ with the median of its past data
- ex) fit an ARIMA model within a sliding window
  - to compute the prediction interval
  - parameters are refitted each time that the window moves

<br>

Extreme Value Theory ( EVT )

- prediction-based approach
- streaming UTS
- using past data and retraining.

<br>

Details of EVT

- given a fixed risk $q$, allows us to obtain a threshold value $z_{q, t}$ that adapts itself to the evolution of the data

  - such that $P\left(X_t>z_{q, t}\right)<q$, for any $t \geq 0$, 
  - assuming that the extreme values follow a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).

- Data is used to both..

  - (1) detect anomalies $\left(X_t>z_{q, t}\right)$ 
  - (2) refine $z_{q, t}$. 

- example)

  - SPOT : for data following any stationary distribution
  - DSPOT : for data that can be subject to concept drift

- retrain the underlying model periodically ( or each time a new point arrives )

  $\rightarrow$ can adapt to the evolution of TS

<br>

All of these techniques are based on $ \mid x_t-\hat{x}_t \mid >\tau$

- but not all the existing point outlier detection methods rely on that idea

  - ex) density-based methods ( $\leftrightarrow$ model-based methods )

    - consider that points with less than $\tau$ neighbors are outliers

      ( $x_t$ is an outlier $\Longleftrightarrow \mid \left\{x \in X \mid d\left(x, x_t\right) \leq R\right\} \mid <\tau$)

<br>

### 1-b) Density-based methods

$x_t \text { is an outlier } \Longleftrightarrow \mid \left\{x \in X \mid d\left(x, x_t\right) \leq R\right\} \mid <\tau$.

- $d$ : (commonly) Euclidean distance
- $x_t$ : data point at $t$ step to be analyzed

<br>

Point is an outlier if $\tau_p+\tau_s<\tau$, 

- $\tau_p$ and $\tau_s$ are the number of preceding and succeeding neighbors at distance lower or equal than $R$

<br>

Widely handled in non-temporal data

- concept of neighborhood is more complex in TS due to the order
- ex) apply this method within a sliding window

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img392.png)

Two different time steps with $R=0.5$, $\tau=3$, and a sliding window of length 11.

- outlier for a window (e.g., O13 at $t=13$ ) 
- NOT outlier for window (e.g., I13 at $t=17$ )

- if a data point has at least $\tau$ succeeding neighbors within a windowâ€¦

  $\rightarrow$ cannot be an outlier for any future evolution (e.g., S4 at $t=13$ ).

<br>

### 1-c) Histogramming

Detecting the points whose removal from the UTS results in a histogram representation with lower error than the original

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img393.png)

<br>

## (2) MTS

Can deal 

- not only with a single variable ( 3.2.1 )
- but also with multiple variables ( 3.2.2 )



Point outlier in a MTS

$\rightarrow$ can affect both univariate / multivariate point

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img394.png)



Some multivariate techniques

$\rightarrow$ able to detect univariate point outliers

<br>

Some univariate techniques

$\rightarrow$ able to detect multivariate point outliers



### 2-a) Univariate techniques.

Univariate analysis can be performed for each variable in MTS

( w/o considering dependencies that may exist between the variables )

<br>

ex) Hundman et al. [2018] : LSTM

- predict spacecraft telemetry and find point outliers within each variable in MTS
- present a dynamic thresholding approach 
  - some smoothed residuals of the model obtained from past data are used to determine the threshold at each time step. 

<br>

ex 2) Dimension Reduction

UTS analysis ignore correlation between TS

$\rightarrow$ some researchers apply a preprocessing method to the MTS to **find a new set of uncorrelated variables** where univariate techniques can be applied. 

- based on dimensionality reduction techniques,

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img395.png)

- ex) incremental PCA ( Papadimitriou et al. [2005] )
  - linear combinations of the initial variables
  - to determine the new independent variables
  - posterior univariate point outlier detection technique that is applied is based on the AR model
- ex)  Reducing the dimensionality with projection pursuit ( Galeano et al. [2006] )
  - aims to find the best projections to identify outliers. 
  - prove that the optimal directions = those that maximize or minimize the kurtosis coefficient of the projected TS
  - Univariate statistical tests [Chen and Liu 1993; Fox 1972] are then applied iteratively to each projected TS
- ex) ICA ( Baragona and Battaglia [2007] )
  - to obtain a set of unobservable independent nonGaussian variables
    - assumtion : observed data has been generated by a linear combination of those variables

<br>

ex 3) Dimension Reduction 2

- reduce the input MTS into a single time-dependent variable 

  ( rather than into a set of uncorrelated variables )

- ex) Lu et al. [2018] 

  - define the transformed UTS using the cross-correlation function between adjacent vectors in time

  - point outliers are iteratively identified in this new TS

    ( = those that have a low correlation with their adjacent multivariate points )

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img396.png)

<br>

### 2-b) Multivariate techniques

Deal simultaneously with multiple time-dependent variables ( w.o transformation )

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img397.png)

<br>

For a predefined threshold $\tau$, outliers are identified if

- $ \mid \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t-\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_t \mid \mid >\tau$.
  - $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ : actual $k$-dimensional data point
  - $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_t$ : expected value
- $\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\boldsymbol{t}}$ can be obtained using â€¦
  - (1) estimation models
  - (2) prediction models

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img398.png)

<br>

### Estimation model-based

***Autoencoder (AE)***

- outliers = non-representative features

  $\rightarrow$ AE fails to reconstruct them

- ex) Sakurada and Yairi [2014] 

  - Input = single MTS point
  - Temporal correlation between the observations within each variable is not considered

- ex) Kieu et al. [2018]

  - propose extracting features within **overlapping sliding windows** before applying AE

    (e.g., statistical features or the difference between the Euclidean norms of two consecutive time windows)

- ex) Su et al. [2019]
  - based on VAE & GRU
  - Input = sequence of observations containing $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ and $l$ preceding observations
  - Output = reconstructed $\boldsymbol{x}_t\left(=\hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_t\right)$. 
  - Apply **extreme value theory** in the reference of normality to **automatically select the threshold value.**

<br>

General trend estimation of multiple co-evolving time series

- ex) Zhou et al. [2019, 2018b] 

  - non-parametric model that considers both 

    - (1) temporal correlation between the values within each variable
    - (2) inter-series relatedness 

    to estimate that trend. 

  - Trend of each variable = estimated using MTS

  - UTS point outliers = identified within each variable

    ( instead of $k$-dim points )

<br>

### Prediction model-based

- Fit a model to a MTS
- ex) Contextual Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) 
  - incrementally captures both 
    - (1) temporal dependencies : 
      - modeled by a basic HMM
    - (2) correlations between the variables in a MTS : 
      - included into the model by adding an extra layer to the HMM network
- ex) DeepAnt algorithm [Munir et al. 2019] 
  -  capable of detecting point outliers in MTS using the CNN
  -  next timestamp is predicted using a window of previous observations

<br>

### Dissimilarity-based methods

Based on computing the pairwise dissimilarity between MTS points

( w.o fitting the model )

For a predefined threshold $\tau, \boldsymbol{x}_{\boldsymbol{t}}$ is a point outlier if:

- $s\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{\boldsymbol{t}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{x}}_{\boldsymbol{t}}\right)>\tau$.

<br>

Do not usually use the raw data directly, 

( instead use different representation methods )

- ex) Cheng et al. [2008, 2009] 
  - represent the data using a graph
    - nodes = points in MTS
    - edges = similarity between them ( = computed with the RBF )
  - apply a random walk model in the graph 
    - outlier = hardly accessible in the graph)
- ex) Li et al. [2009] 
  - propose recording the historical similarity and dissimilarity values between the variables in a vector. 
  - analyze the dissimilarity of consecutive points over time

<br>

### Summary

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img399.png)

<br>

# 4. Subsequence Outliers

Goal : identify a **set of consecutive points** that jointly behave unusually

Key aspects

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img400.png)

<br>



**(1) Fixed-length ( $\leftrightarrow$ variable length ) subsequences**

- need the user to predefine the length
- ( commonly ) obtain the subsequences using a sliding window over TS

<br>

**(2) Representation**

- comparison between subsequences is challenging
- rather than raw value, use representations
  - ex) Discretization
    - equal-frequency binning, equal-width binning 
  - ex) Dictionaries
    - directly to obtain representations based on dictionaries

<br>

**(3) Periodicity**

Periodic subsequence outliers 

- are unusual subsequences that repeat over time 
- Unlike point outliers where periodicity is not relevant, periodic subsequence outliers are important in areas such as fraud detection

<br>

Subsequences consider the temporality by default!

<br>

When analyzing subsequence outliers in a streaming contextâ€¦ 3 cases

- (1) a single data point arrives
  - answer must be given for a subsequence containing this new point
- (2) a subsequence arrives
  - needs to be marked as an outlier or non-outlier
- (3) a batch of data arrives and subsequence outliers need to be found within it

Most of the models are fixed & do not adapt to changes in the streaming sequence

$\rightarrow$  focus on the incremental techniques!

( = more suitable for processing streaming TS )

<br>

## (1) UTS

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img401.png)

<br>

### 1-a) Discord detection

Comparing each subsequence with the others

<br>

$D$ is a discord of time series $X$ if

- $\forall S \in A, \min _{D^{\prime} \in A, D \cap D^{\prime}=\emptyset}\left(d\left(D, D^{\prime}\right)\right)>\min _{S^{\prime} \in A, S \cap S^{\prime}=\emptyset}\left(d\left(S, S^{\prime}\right)\right)$.
  - $A$ : set of all subsequences of $X$ extracted by a sliding window
  - $D^{\prime}$ : subsequence in $A$ that does not overlap with $D$ 
    - $S^{\prime}$ in $A$ does not overlap with $S$ 
  - $d$ : Euclidean distance

<br>

Discord discovery techniques require the user to specify the length of the discord.

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img402.png)

<br>

Simplest Way : **Brute-force**

- requires a quadratic pairwise comparison
- speed up by HOT-SAX algorithm

<br>

Limited to finding the most unusual subsequence within a TS

Problem : do not have a reference of normality or a threshold

- cannot specify whether it is indeed an outlier or not

$\rightarrow$ Decision must be made by the user. 

<br>

### 1-b) Dissimilarity-based methods 

based on the direct comparison of subsequences, using a reference of normality

$\rightarrow$ reference of normality vary widely 

( in contrast to the dissimilarity-based techniques analyzed MTS + point outliers )

<br>

For a predefined threshold $\tau$ , subsequence outliers are those that are dissimilar to normal subsequences

- $s(S, \hat{S})>\tau$.

  - $S$ : the subsequence being analyzed

  - $\hat{S}$ : expected value of $S$ 

    ( = obtained based on the reference of normality )

- Typically, $S$ is of fixed-length, non-periodic, and extracted via a sliding window

<br>

How to obtain $\hat{S}$ ?

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img403.png)

<br>

***(A) same TS***

Clustering techniques 

- commonly use this reference of normality to create clusters 

- $s(S, \hat{S})>\tau$. can be defined by the centroid of the cluster

  ![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img404.png)

<br>

***(B) external TS***

Rely on an external TS as a reference of normality

$\rightarrow$ assuming that it has been generated by the same underlying process but with no outliers.

<br>

***(C) previous subsequence***

only use the previous adjacent non-overlapping window to the subsequence being analyzed as the reference of normality, 

$\rightarrow$ have a much more local perspective than the others

<br>

### 1-c) Prediction-based methods

Assume that normality is reflected by a time series composed of past subsequences. 

- $\sum_{i=p}^{p+n-1} \mid x_i-\hat{x}_i \mid>\tau$.
  - $S=x_p, \ldots, x_{p+n-1}$ : subsequence being analyzed
  - $\hat{S}$ : its predicted value

<br>

Predictions can be made in 2 different manners: 

- (1) point-wise
  - make predictions for as many points as the length of the subsequence iteratively
  - errors accumulate
- (2) subsequence-wise
  - calculates predictions for whole subsequences at once (not iteratively)
  - ex) use CNN

<br>

### 1-d) Frequency-based methods

 A subsequence $S$ is an outlier if it does not appear as frequently as expected:
- $\mid f(S)-\hat{f}(S)\mid >\tau$.
  - $f(S)$ : frequency of occurrence of $S$ 
  - $\hat{f}(S)$ : its expected frequency

<br>

Due to the difficulty of finding two exact real-valued subsequences in a TS when counting the frequencies

$\rightarrow$ work with a discretized time series.

<br>

### 1-e) Information-based methods



A paradigmatic example can be found in Keogh et al. [2002]. Given an external univariate time series as reference, a subsequence extracted via a sliding window in a new univariate time series is an outlier relative to that reference if the frequency of its occurrence in the new series is very different to that expected. Rasheed and Alhajj [2014] also
