# 0. Abstract

poor performance of applying DL models in **short TS**

$$\rightarrow$$ solve with **Transfer Learning**

( + propose **similiarity-based approach for selecting source datasets** )

<br>

Setting

- 2 source datasets
- 1 target datsets

<br>

# 1. TL in TS Forecasting

Recent works

- Ye et al [27] : propose a novel transfer learning for TS forecasting

- Fawaz et al [8] : calculate similarity to select source datasets

  - propose DTW based algorithm

- Hu et al [14] : pre-train a 2-layer DNN

  - parameters of model are shared with all TS

    ( = universal feature transformation )

<br>

Proposed work

- 1st layer DNN : train with **one** source dartaset
- 2nd layer DNN : train with **both** source datasets

$$\rightarrow$$ not only **universal** features, but also **specific** features

<br>

# 2. Method

## (1) Training Strategy

- multi-domain TL
- all source domains ***may not have same influence on target domain**

<br>

This paper :

- not only contain **universal features**
- but also maintain **specific features** of the source domains

## (2) Network Architecture

1. 2-layer DNN
2. 2-layer LSTM
