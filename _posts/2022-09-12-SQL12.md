# (1) Transaction Concept

## a) Transaction 

- is a **unit of program execution** that accesses and possibly updates various data items

- must see a **"consistent"** DB
- **during** transaction execution, the DB **may be inconsistent**

- when the transaction is committed, the DB **must be consistent**

<br>

2 main issues :

- **Failures** of various kinds ( ex. hardware failures and system crashes )

- **"Concurrent" execution** of multiple transactions

<br>

## b) ACID properties

to preserve integrity of data ...

- [A] Atomicity
  - either **ALL** operations of the transaction are properly reflected in the DB or **NONE** are
- [C] Consistency
  - execution of a transaction in isolation **preserves the consistency of the DB**
- [I] Isolation
  - although multiple transactions **may execute concurrently**, each transaction must be **unaware of other concurrently executing transactions**
- [D] Durability
  - after a transaction completes successfully, **the changes it has made to the DB persist, even if there are system failures**

<br>

## c) Example

Transaction to transfer $50 from account A to account B:

```
1. read(A)

2. A := A – 50

3. write(A)

4. read(B)

5. B := B + 50

6. write(B)
```

<br>

Requirements

### (a) Consistency

- ***the sum of A and B is unchanged*** by the execution of the transaction

<br>

### (b) Atomicity

- if the transaction fails after step 3 and before step 6, 

  the system should ensure that ***its updates are not reflected*** in the DB, else an inconsistency will result

<br>

### (c) Durability

- once the user has been notified that the transaction has completed,

  the **updates** to the DB by the transaction **must persist despite failures**

<br>

### (d) Isolation

- if **another transaction is allowed to access the partially updated DB** between steps 3 and 6, it will see an inconsistent DB (the sum A+B will be less than it should be)

- Isolation can be ensured trivially **by running transactions serially**,
   that is one after the other. 

  However, **executing multiple transactions concurrently** has significant benefits, as we will see

<br>

## d) Operations in transaction

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img90.png)

<br>

### (a) Commit

- transaction이 ***성공적으로 완료***되었음을 선언하는 연산
- commit 실행 시, transaction의 결과가 DB에 반영 & 일관된 상태를 지속적으로 유지

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img91.png)

<br>

### (b) Rollback

- transaction이 ***실패 했음***을 선언하는 연산

- Rollback 실행 시, transaction이 지금까지 실행한 연산의 결과가 취소

  & DB가 transaction 수행 전의 일관된 상태로 되돌아감

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img92.png)

<br>

# (2) Transaction State

(1) Active

- the **initial state**
- transaction stays in this state **while it is executing**

(2) Partially committed

- **after the final statement has been executed**

(3) Failed

- after the discovery that normal execution **can no longer proceed**

(4) Aborted

- after the transaction has been **rolled back**

  & DB restored to its state **prior to the start of the transaction**

(5) Committed

- **after successful completion**

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img93.png)

<br>

# (3) Implementation of Atomicity & Durability

[1] **Recovery-management** component of DB

- implements the support for "atomicity" and "durability"

<br>

[2] **Shadow-DB** scheme

- assume that only **"one transaction is active at a time"**
- a "pointer called **db_pointer**" always points to the current consistent copy of the DB
- all updates are **made on a shadow copy of the DB**
- in case transaction fails, old consistent copy pointed to by db_pointer can be used, and the shadow copy can be deleted

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img94.png)

- Useful for text editors ...

  - but extremely **inefficient for large DB**

  - executing a single transaction requires **copying the entire DB**

<br>

# (4) Concurrent Executions

## a) Introduction

**Multiple transactions** are allowed to run concurrently in the system

<brR>

Advantages :

- Increased **processor and disk utilization**

- Reduced **average response time**

<br>

**Concurrency control schemes**

- Mechanisms to **achieve isolation**

- Control the interaction among the concurrent transactions in order to **prevent them from destroying the consistency of the DB**

<br>

## b) Schedules

- **sequences** that indicate the **chronological order** in which instructions of concurrent transactions are executed

- **must consist of all instructions of those transactions**

- must preserve the **order in which the instructions appear** in each individual transaction

<br>

# (5) Serializability ( = 직렬성 )

Each transaction is assumed to preserve database consistency

$$\rightarrow$$ $$\therefore$$ **serial execution** of a set of transactions preserves **DB consistency**

<br>

A schedule is serializable, if it is equivalent to a **serial schedule**

- a) **Conflict serializable**

- b) **View serializable**

<br>

We ignore operations other than read and write instructions

<br>

## a) Conflict serializable

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img98.png)

<br>

A conflict between $$l_i$$ and $$l_j$$  **forces a temporal order** between them

If $$l_i$$ and $$l_j$$ are consecutive in a schedule & they do not conflict...

$$\rightarrow$$ their results would **remain the same even** if they had been **interchanged in the schedule**

<br>

### Conflict Equivalent

Schedule $$S$$ & $$S^{'}$$ are ***conflict equivalent***...

- If  $$S$$ can be transformed into $$S^{’}$$ by a series of swaps of **non-conflicting instructions**

<br>

### Conflict serializable 

Schedule $$S$$ is ***conflict serializable***..

- If $$S$$ is conflict equivalent to a serial schedule

<br>

Example )

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img99.png)

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img100.png)

<br>

## b) View serializable

Let $$S$$ and $$S^{’}$$ be 2 schedules with the same set of transactions.

<br>

### View equivalent

$$S$$ & $$S^{'}$$ are view equivalent .... 

if the following **3 conditions** are met for each data item Q

<br>

- If transaction $$T_i$$ reads the **initial value of Q in schedule S**

  $$\rightarrow$$ transaction $$T_i$$ must also read the **initial value of Q in schedule  $$S^{'}$$**

- If transaction $$T_i$$ executes **read**(Q) in schedule $$S$$ 

  & that value was produced by transaction $$T_j$$

  $$\rightarrow$$ then transaction $$T_i$$ must also read the **value of Q in schedule  $$S^{'}$$  that was produced by transaction $$T_j$$**

- If transaction $$T_i$$ performs the final **write**(Q) operation in schedule $$S$$

  $$\rightarrow$$  then transaction $$T_i$$ must also perform the final **write**(Q) operation in schedule  $$S^{'}$$ 

<br>

Summary

- ***A schedule S is "view serializable" if it is view equivalent to a serial schedule***

- Every conflict serializable schedule is also view serializable

<br>

Example ) view serializable (O) , conflict serializable (X)

# (6) Testing for Serializability

Notation

- $$T_1 \cdots T_n$$ : set of transcations

<br>

Precedence graph :

- **direct graph** where the **vertices represent the transactions**

- draw an arc from $$T_i$$ to $$T_j$$...
  - if the two transactions conflict and $$T_i$$ accessed the data item earlier on which the conflict arose 

![figure2](/assets/img/sql/img102.png)

<br>

Details :

- A schedule is **conflict serializable** $$\leftrightarrow$$ its **precedence graph is acyclic**

- precedence graph is **acyclic** $$\rightarrow$$ the serializability order can be obtained by a **topological sorting of the graph**

- The problem of checking if a schedule is view serializable falls in the class of **NP-complete problems**

- However practical algorithms that just check some sufficient conditions for view serializability can still be used
