# Abstract

$D^3VAE$

- Address the TS forecasting problem with generative modeling
- Bidirectional VAE (BVAE) equipped with diffusion, denoise, and disentanglement
- Coupled diffusion probabilistic model 
  - To augment the TS data without increasing the aleatoric uncertainty & implement a more tractable inference process with BVAE

- Propose to adapt and integrate the multiscale denoising score matching into the diffusion process for TS forecasting
- To enhance the interpretability and stability of the prediction, treat the latent variable in a multivariate manner and disentangle them on top of minimizing total correlation
