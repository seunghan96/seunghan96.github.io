### Neural Decomposition (ND)

- NN for "analysis" & "extrapolation" of time-series data

- use 2 kinds of units

  - 1) Units with **"sinusoidal activation function"**

    ( perform Fourier-like decomposition )

  - 2) Units with **"non-periodic activation function"**

    ( to capture linear trend & other non-periodic components )

<br>

# 1. Introduction

Analyzing time series data 2 ways :

<br>

### [ approach 1 ] interpretation

interpret **TS as a signal** & apply Fourier transform to **decompose it into a sum of sinusoids**

- Fourier transform = uses a **pre-determined** set of sinusoid frequencies ( DO NOT LEARN )

  $$\rightarrow$$ ***effective at interpolation, but bad at extrapolation***

<br>

### [ approach 2 ] regression & extrapolation

use models, such as NN

- Fourier NN : "sinusoidal activation functions"

  $$\rightarrow$$ but, difficult to train

- RNN : difficulty in handling unevenly sampled TS

<br>

### Proposal : ND

**effective generalization** can be achieved by...

- **regression & extrapolation**, using a model with 2 properties!

<br>

2 properties

- 1) combine both PERIODIC & NON-PERIODIC components
- 2) must be able to TUNE its components & weights ( = learnable )

<br>

Neural Decomposition (ND)

- 1) like Fourier Transform.... 
  - **decompose signal** into sum of constituent parts
- 2) unlike Fourier Transform.... 
  - able to reconstruct a signal **"that is useful for extrapolating"**
  - does not require the number of samples to be a power of two
  - does not require that samples be measured at regular intervals

- **3) includes "non-periodic" components**
  - ex) linear, sigmoidal components
  - account for trends & non-linear irregularities

<br>

## (1) Models for TS prediction

<br>

ND falls into **(C) regression-based extrapolation**

- fit a curve to a data & predict new data using the trained curve

- advantage over RNN

  - can make continuous predictions

- closely related to **Fourier NN**

  ( due to its use of "sinusoidal activation functions" )

<br>

## (2) Harmonic Analysis

**Harmonic Analysis** of signal

( = Spectral analysis, Spectral density estimation )

- transform a set of samples from **"TIME" domain $$\rightarrow$$ "FREQUENCY" domain**
- Interpolation & Extrapolation
  - **( interpolation  )** able to reconstruct the original signal
  - **( extrapolation )** able to forecast values beyond the sampled time window
- ex) DFT **(Discrete Fourier Transform)**

<br>

### DFT & iDFT

- **( DFT )** time $$\rightarrow$$ frequency

  - use "negative multiples of $$2\pi / N$$" as frequencies

- **( iDFT )** frequency $$\rightarrow$$ time

  - can be used as a **continuous representation** of the originally discrete input
  - use "positive multiples of $$2\pi / N$$" as frequencies
  - contains normalization term $$1/N$$

- written as a **sum of $$N$$ complex exponentials**

  **( in terms of sines & cosines )**

<br>

### iDFT

Notation

- $$R_k$$ : "REAL" components of $$k$$th complex number, returned by DFT
- $$I_k$$ : "IMAGINARY" components of $$k$$th complex number, returned by DFT
- $$2\pi k /N$$ : "frequency" of $$k$$th term
  - first frequency ( $$k=0$$ ) : bias  ( $$\because$$ $$cos(0)=1$$, $$sin(0)=0 $$)
  - second frequency ( $$k=1$$ ) : single wave
  - third frequencey ( $$k=2$$ ) : two waves
  - ...
- cosine with $$k$$-th frequency : scaled by $$R_k$$
- sine with $$k$$-th frequency : scaled by $$I_k$$

<br>

Summary :

- sum of $$N/2 +1$$ terms, with $$sin(t)$$ & $$cos(t)$$ in each term

- $$x(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{N / 2} R_{k} \cdot \cos \left(\frac{2 \pi k}{N} t\right)-I_{k} \cdot \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi k}{N} t\right)$$.

  $$\rightarrow$$ useful as a "continuous representation" of the real-valued discrete input

<br>

Problem :

- iDFT assumes .... $$x(t+N)=x(t)$$ for all $$t$$
- cannot effectively model the "non-periodic components of a signal"

## (3) Fourier NN

Fourier NN = NN that use a **Fourier-like neuron**

- case 1) input = Fourier transform of some data
- case 2) weight = Fourier transform

<br>

# 3. Neural Decomposition

describe ND (Neural Decomposition) for analysis & extrapolation of TS data

<br>

1. allow **sinusoid frequencies to be TRAINED**
2. augment the sinusoids with a **NON-PERIODIC FUNCTION**, to model non-periodic components

<br>

Notation

- $$a_k$$ : amplitude

- $$w_k$$ : frequency

- $$\phi_k$$ : phase shift

- $$g(t)$$ : augmentation function

  ( = represents the non-periodic components of the signal )

<br>

Model

- $$x(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{N}\left(a_{k} \cdot \sin \left(w_{k} t+\phi_{k}\right)\right)+g(t)$$.
- comparison with iDFT
  - (1) $$k=0$$ $$\rightarrow$$ $$k=1$$ 
    - no need for bias term ( now, we have $$g(t)$$ )
  - (2) $$N/2$$ $$\rightarrow$$ $$N$$
    - $$N/2$$ sines & cosines each $$\rightarrow$$ $$N$$ sines only
