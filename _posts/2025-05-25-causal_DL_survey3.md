# Causal Inference Meets Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Survey

<br>

# 5. DL with Causal Inference

### Causal discovery 

= ***Inferring causal relationships*** from ***data***

<br>

### DL + CI

Traditional DL

- Relies on large IID datasets
- Focus on correlation rather than causation
  - Correlation-based models: Unstable and sensitive to small data changes

<br>

<br>

Causal learning 

- Improve generalization, stability, and interpretability in DL

## (1) Adversarial Learning 

- Goal: Maintaining **model stability/robustness**
  - In the presence of **malicious environments**
- How? By adding perturbations to real samples
  - NN will misled in their judgments by new adversarial samples
- Divided into 
  - (1) Adversarial attacks
  - (2) Adversarial defenses 

## (2) Contrastive Learning

## (3) Diffusion Models

## (4) Reinforcement Learning

## (5) Recommendation Algorithm
