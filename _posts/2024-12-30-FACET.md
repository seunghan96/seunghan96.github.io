# 1. Introduction

**FACET** 

( = **Fairness in Computer Vision Evaluation Benchmark** )

- Dataset to evaluate a benchmark for **fairness of computer vision models**
- Previous works: have **biases** (example below)

Few more annotations, other than **class**

- e.g., **perceived gender presentation**, **skin tone** ...

<br>

# 3. Statistics

Details

- Contains **32k images** and **50k people** ( including images with more than 1 people )

- Each person is also surrounded with a **bounding box**

  $$\rightarrow$$ Can be used for **object detection** 

- **69k masks** labeled as person, hair or clothing

  $$\rightarrow$$ Can be used for **image segmentation**

- Various more attributes 
  - e.g., hair details, face masks, tattoo and lighting..
