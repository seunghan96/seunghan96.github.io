# Abstract

**Financial time series (FinTS)**

$$\rightarrow$$ Three systemic limitations in the evaluation of the area

<br>

### a) Limitations

- (1) Diversity Gap
  - Failure to account for the **full spectrum** of stock movement patterns
- (2) Standardization Deficit
  - Absence of **unified** assessment protocols
- (3) Real-World Mismatch
  - Neglect of **critical market structure factors**
  - Resulting in inflated performance metrics that lack practical applicability

<br>

### b) Proposal: **FinTSB**

Comprehensive and practical benchmark for FinTSF

- **Solve (1) Diversity Gap**: To increase the variety

  $$\rightarrow$$ Categorize movement patterns into ***"four specific parts"***

- **Solve (2) Standardization Deficit**: To eliminate biases due to different evaluation settings

  $$\rightarrow$$ Standardize the metrics across ***"three dimensions"*** & Build a user-friendly, lightweight pipeline incorporating methods from various backbones

- **Solve (e) Real-World Mismatch**: To accurately simulate real-world trading scenarios

  $$\rightarrow$$ Extensively model various regulatory constraints, including transaction fees, among others. 

<br>

# 1. Introduction

## (1) Financial time series (FinTS) forecasting 

### a) Financial time series

Def) Sequence of data points which are...

- Ordered chronologically
- Represent asset price factors or market indicators
- Reflect the dynamic behavior of financial markets

<br>

### b) Financial time series (FinTS) forecasting 

- Unlike general TS prediction challenges ...

- Stock prices are **not merely statistical series**, 

  but the **manifestation of complex, often chaotic human behavior**

  ( Shaped by many cognitive, emotional, and sociopolitical factors )

$$\rightarrow$$ FinTSF has emerged as a cutting-edge domain of scholarly exploration!

<br>

<br>

## (2) Categorization of FinTSF methods

**Six types** based on their underlying **backbone**

- [Early methods] Derived from practitioner experience
  - **(1) Classic strategies**
    - Momentum [28] and mean reversion [51]
  - **(2) ML methods** 
    - ARIMA [4], XGBoost [6], LightGBM [30], and Random Forests [78]
- [Recent methods] Non-linear relationships
  - **(3) DL methods**
    - Based on RNN, CNN, Transformer, Mamba, GNN
    - To model both stock features and inter-stock correlations
    - Dominant paradigm in the FinTSF field
  - **(4) RL-based methods**
    - To better optimize sequential decision making processes
    - End-to-end optimization of some key non-differentiable metrics (such as the sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown)
  - **(5) Generative model-based methods**
    - VAE and Diffusion Models
    - Reflect the heightened levels of uncertainty characteristic of the market, accounting for the low signal-to-noise FinTS
  - **(6) LLMs**
    - Process vast amounts of unstructured data and perform sophisticated reasoning
    - e.g., Enhancer [33, 75]
      - Utilize news sentiment and other textual information to augment decision making
    - e.g., Predictor [40, 55]
      - Leverage extensive TS training to generalize effectively across different domains
    - e.g., LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) [32, 35, 72]
      - Autonomous agents are employed to replicate decision-making processes, communication, and interactions

<br>

## (3) Lack of comprehensive benchmarks

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img694.png)

Demand for **comprehensive and practical empirical evaluations**!

Nonetheless... existing evaluation frameworks often face challenges!

- **(1) Diversity Gap**
- **(2) Standardization Deficit**
- **(3) Real-World Mismatch**

<br>

## (4) Solution: FinTSB

Novel ***evaluation*** framework

$$\rightarrow$$ To enhance the robustness and applicability of empirical assessments

$$\rightarrow$$ Improve the evaluation capabilities in FinTSF

<br>

### a) Diversity Gap

Inherent complexity of financial markets

***[Case 1] Different phases of stock movement***

- (1) Uptrends
- (2) Downtrends
- (3) Periods of volatility
- (4) Extreme events (black swan events)

**Dataset A vs. B**

- Dataset (A): Contain only 3~5 years of historical data

  $$\rightarrow$$ Fails to comprehensively represent all possible movement patterns

- Dataset (B): Decades of data

  $$\rightarrow$$ Suffer from severe distribution shifts

<br>

***[Case 2] Distinct characteristics in different markets***

**Dataset C vs. D**

- Dataset (C) Chinese stock market
  - High retail participation & higher volatility
- Dataset (D) U.S. stock market
  - More balanced mix of institutional and retail investors & Generally higher degree of efficiency

$$\rightarrow$$ Some existing works evaluate models in only one market!

<br>

Proposal: ***Emphasizes the diversity of FinTS***

- a) Comprehensiveness of movement patterns
  - Fine-grained analysis of how different methods perform over different periods of market volatility
- b) Broad scope of financial markets

<br>

### b) Standardization Deficit

***Discrepancies in evaluation criteria***

$$\rightarrow$$ Inconsistencies in performance comparisons

<br>

Solution: Classify the current evaluation metrics into 3main categories

- (1) Ranking metrics
  - Assess the distribution between predicted and actual daily returns
- (2) Portfolio-based metrics, 
  - Evaluate the profitability and risk of investment strategies derived from predictions
- (3) Error metrics
  - Quantify the degree of approximation between predicted and true values

$$\rightarrow$$ Note that **forecasting errors** show little correlation with **overall investment returns**

<br>

Lack a standardized pipeline for evaluation

$$\rightarrow$$ Need for a **unified, user-friendly, and lightweight evaluation** framework

<br>

### c) Real-world Alignment

Stringent requirements for simulating realistic trading conditions

$$\rightarrow$$ Recent works overlooks these constraints!

<br>

Example) 

- (1) Some models still assume short selling in the Chinese A-share market

  $$\rightarrow$$ Impractical due to restrictions in certain sectors

- (2) Do not take transaction fees into account

  $$\rightarrow$$ Critical when constructing portfolios based on the prediction of stocks with top-ùëò returns. 

<br>

Proposal: Emphasize the necessity of **incorporating these real-world constraints** into evaluations 

<br>

### Contribution

1. Diversity Inclusion
   - Collect and pre-process tokenization historical financial TS data
   - Captures all types of movement patterns across various markets. 
2. Standardization Consistency
   - Comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of various methods from three perspectives
   - (1) Ranking & (2) Portfolio & (3) Error
3. Real-World Alignment
   - We meticulously design investment strategies that align with real-world market conditions, facilitating practical implementation in actual trading environments. 
4. In-depth Evaluation
   - Evaluate a wide range of FinTSF methods
   - Extract key insights that advance the understanding of model performance in the context of financial TS forecasting

<br>

# 2. Preliminaries

## (1) Problem Definition

### a) Stock Context

$$S=\left\{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N\right\} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times L \times F}$$: Set of all stocks 

- $$s_i$$: Specific stock

  - $$s_i^t \in \mathrm{R}^F$$: Data on trading day $$t$$

    ( with the closing price $$p_f^t$$ as one of the features )

- $$N$$: Total number of stocks

- $$L$$: Length of the lookback window

- $$F$$: Number of features

<br>

**One-day return ratio**: $$r_i^t=\frac{p_i^t-p_l^{t-1}}{\rho_i^{t-1}}$$. 

<br>

**Ranking ( on any trading day $$t$$ )**

- Ranked according to their underlying scores (based on return ratios)
- Scores:  $$Y^t=\left\{y_1^t \geq y_2^t \geq \ldots \geq y_N^t\right\}$$. 
  - If $$r_i^t \geq r_j^t$$, then $$y_i^t \geq y_j^t$$. 

<br>

### b) Financial TS forecasting

- Input) Stock-specific time series information of $$\mathcal{S}$$ 

- Goal) Develop a ranking function that predicts the scores $$Y^{L+1}$$  ( for the next day )

  & Ordering the stocks $$s_i$$ by their expected profitability

<br>

## (2) Sequence Characteristics

For a more thorough evaluation of the **sophisticated dynamics**

<br>

### Characteristic 1. Movement Patterns

( Notation: daily return ratio $$r$$ )

Movement pattern

- (1) Uptrends

  = Higher frequency of trading days with positive $$r$$

- (2) Downtrends

  = Higher frequency of trading days with negative $$r$$

- (3) Periods of volatility

  = Roughly equal number of positive and negative $$r$$

  = More frequent market fluctuations without a clear directional trend

- (4) Extreme events

  = Defined by significant fluctuations in $$r$$

  = Representing periods of sharp price movements

<br>

### Characteristic 2. Non-Stationarity

Stock data typically exhibit **non-stationarity**

Such TS are considered to be **integrated of order $$k$$** denoted as $$I(k)$$

($$\leftrightarrow$$ Becomes stationary after applying $$k$$ times differences )

<br>

How to test?

- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- Null hypothesis: "TS is non-stationary"
  - $$\Delta s_i^t=\alpha+\beta t+\gamma s_i^{t-1}+\sum_{j=1}^p \delta_j \Delta s_i^{t-j}+\epsilon_t$$.

$$\therefore$$ Smaller ADF test result $$\rightarrow$$ More stationary TS

<br>

### Characteristic 3. Autocorrelation

Measures the degree to which a stock‚Äôs ***past price*** movements influence its ***future behavior***

$$\tau\left(s_i\right)=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{L-k}\left(s_i^t-\bar{s}_i\right)\left(s_i^{t+k}-\bar{s}_i\right)}{\sum_{t=1}^L\left(s_i^t-\bar{s}_i\right)^2}$$.

<br>

### Characteristic 4. Forecastability

(Following ForeCA [17])

Leverage frequency domain properties to assess the forecastability $$\phi(\cdot)$$ of a TS

- Higher value $$\phi(x)$$ $$\rightarrow$$ $$x$$ exhibits a lower forecast uncertainty ( = higher forecastability )

<br>

$$\phi\left(s_i\right)=1-\frac{H\left(s_i\right)}{\log (2 \pi)}$$.

- where $$H(\cdot)$$ denotes the entropy derived from the Fourier decomposition of the TS

<br>

# 3. FinTSB

## (1) Dataset Details

### a) Dataset Construction

- **Step 1) Tokenization & Preprocessing**

  - Normalization at the stock dimension for each trading day

    ( Not across the time dimension!! )

- **Step 2) Segmentation (patching)**

  - Divide 15 years of historical stock data into non-overlapping segments

- **Step 3) Calculate return**

  - Calculate the daily return (change rate) $$r$$ for each stock

- **Step 4) Categorization**

  - Categorize the stocks in each fixed 250-day segment,

    Into one of four distinct movement patterns,

    Based on the return (in step 2) 

  - (1) Extreme outliers $$\rightarrow$$ Black swan eventes
  - (2) Remainings $$\rightarrow$$ Rank them based on a positive change rate
    - Top 300 = uptrends
    - Bottom 300 = downtrends
    - Remaining 300 = volatility

- **Step 5) Choose 5 segments per 4 patterns**

  - Compute sequence characteristics for each pattern

    &  Choose 5 appropriate segments per pattern

  - Result: 5 smaller datasets for each of the 4 movement patterns

    $$\rightarrow$$ Total of 20 datasets in the FinTSB. 

<br>

Summary: FinTSB is comprehensive and diverse, accurately reflecting the dynamics of the financial market!

<br>

### b) Dataset Overview

[1] 20 datasets (containing 300 stocks)

- 4 different movement patterns
- 5 segments 
- No overlap between any two datasets & Split = 7:1:2 ratio

<br>

[2] Statistics

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img695.png)

- All patterns exhibit strong non-stationarity

- Uptrend and downtrend patterns tend to exhibit higher autocorrelation

  $$\rightarrow$$ Persistence of their directional movements

- Predictability of different movement patterns varies significantly
  - Uptrends and downtrends generally being more predictable

<br>

[3] Summary 

- Encompasses a wide variety of sequence indicators
- Captures the multifaceted nature of FinTS
- Enables the exploration of diverse forecasting challenges

<br>

## (2) Comparison Baselines

Covers the six categories of methods 

- (1) Classic strategies: CSM [28], BLSW [51]
- (2) ML-based methods: XGBoost [6], LightGBM [30], DoubleEnsemble [2020], ARIMA [4]
- (3) DL-based methods: Linear, LSTM [22], ALSTM [52], GRU [10], GCN [31], GAT [59], TCN [3], Transformer [58], Mamba [18], PatchTST [47], Crossformer [76], iTransformer [43], AMD [24], PDF [11], Localformer [77].

- (5) Generative-based methods: DDPM [21], DDIM [57], FactorVAE [15]
- (6) LLM-based methods: Timer [44], Time-MoE [55], Chronos [2]

<br>

## (3)  Evaluation Metrics

11 metrics (across 3 dimensions)

- a) Ranking (4 metrics) 
- b) Portfolio (5 metrics)
- c) Error (2 metrics)

<br>

### a) Ranking Metrics

Assess the performance of **"predicted ranking scores (returns) $$Y$$"**

- Measure both cross-sectional and predictive power

<br>

**[1] Information Coefficient (IC)** 

$$\mathrm{IC}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\sum_{k=1}^t\left(r_i^k-\bar{r}_i\right)\left(Y_i^k-\bar{Y}_i\right)}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^t\left(r_i^k-\bar{r}_i\right)^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^t\left(Y_i^k-\bar{Y}_i\right)^2}}$$.

- Goal: Quantifies the directional alignment between..
  - (1) Predicted $$Y$$ 
  - (2) GT $$r$$
- Metric: Spearman correlation coefficient
- Evaluates the raw predictive power of scores $$Y$$
  - Statistically significant positive IC values $$\rightarrow$$ Meaningful forecasting power.

<br>

**[2] Information Coefficient Information Ratio (ICIR)**

$$\left(\mathrm{ICIR}=\frac{\text { mean }(\mathrm{IC})}{\operatorname{std}(\mathrm{IC})}\right)$$.

- Goal: Measures the **stability** of the performance of $$Y$$ 
- How: By comparing the annualized **mean IC** with its **temporal volatility**

<br>

**[3] Rank Information Coefficient (RankIC)**

$$\text { RankIC }=1-\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{6 \sum_{k=1}^t\left(R\left(r_i^k\right)-R\left(Y_j^k\right)\right)^2}{t\left(t^2-1\right)}$$, where $$R(\cdot)$$ is the rank function.

- Goal: To eliminate scaling artifacts and reduces sensitivity to outlier bias

- How: Employs dual-ranking normalization

  $$\rightarrow$$ Before calculating the correlation, both $$Y$$ and $$r$$ are converted to uniform percentile ranks

- Metric: Spearman correlation metric

<br>

**[4] Rank Information Coefficient Information Ratio (RankICIR)** 

$$\text { RankICIR }=\frac{\text { mean }(\text { RankIC })}{\text { std(RankIC })}$$.

- Goal: Evaluate the reliability of rank-based relationships between $$Y$$ and $$r$$.

<br>

### b) Portfolio-Based Metrics

Evaluate the strategies through ***simulated portfolio implementation***

<br>

**[5] Annualized Return Ratio (ARR)**

ARR $$=$$ $$(1+\text { Total Return })^{\frac{252}{n}}-1$$

- Primary indicator of strategy profitability
- **Geometric mean return** of a strategy annualized over the **evaluation period**

<br>

**[6] Annualized Volatility (AVol)** 

$$\mathrm{AVol}=\sqrt{252 \cdot \operatorname{Var}\left(R_p\right)}$$,  where $$R_p$$ denotes the daily return of the portfolio. 

- Quantifies the dispersion of strategy returns

- Captures the consistency of performance delivery
  - **Lower** values $$\rightarrow$$ **More stable** return streams

<br>

**[7] Maximum Draw Down (MDD)**

$$\mathrm{MDD}=-\max \left(\frac{p_{\text {peak }}-p_{\text {trough }}}{p_{\text {peak }}}\right)$$

- Represents the **largest peak-totrough decline** ( $$\left.p_{\text {peak }}-p_{\text {trough }}\right)$$ over the **evaluation period** 
- Critical in assessing the **strategy's risk tolerance**

<br>

**[8] Annualized Sharpe Ratio (ASR)**

$$\mathrm{ASR}=\frac{\mathrm{ARR}}{\mathrm{AVol}}$$.

- Measures the excess return per unit of total risk
- Assesses risk-adjusted performance

<br>

**[9] Information Ratio (IR)**

$$\mathrm{IR}=\frac{\operatorname{mean}\left(R_p-R_b\right)}{\operatorname{std}\left(R_p-R_b\right)}$$, where $$R_b$$ is the daily return of the market index

- Assesses the ability to generate **excess** returns relative to a **benchmark**

<br>

### c) Error Metrics

( Note that a lower MSE or MAE does not guarantee profitability! )

$$\rightarrow$$ Market impact, position sizing rules and transaction costs ultimately determine the success of the strategy!

- [10] $$\mathrm{MSE}=\frac{1}{L} \sum_{t=0}^L\left(Y_i^t-r_i^t\right)^2$$.
- [11] $$\mathrm{MAE}=\frac{1}{L} \sum_{t=0}^L \mid Y_i^t-r_i^t \mid $$.

<br>

## (4) Unified Pipeline

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img696.png)

Divergent evaluation criteria

$$\rightarrow$$ Differences in model performance!

<br>

How to ensure a fair, comprehensive, and practical evaluation?

$$\rightarrow$$ ***Unified pipeline*** ,that is structurally divided into ...

- (1) Data layer
- (2) Training layer
- (3) Backtesting layer
- (4) Feedback layer

<br>

### a) Data Layer 

- Comprehensive market information in FinTSB
- Four different movement patterns
- Data pre processing..
  - (1) Tokenization (anonymization)
  - (2) Normalization
- Dataloader 
  - Dynamically constructs global training/validation/test sets based on the selected movement modes. 
- Cross-pattern evaluation through transfer learning 
  - Training on pattern A and testing on pattern B
  - Enables granular analysis of strategy adaptability across market regimes
  - For assessing model generalization capabilities. 
- Historical stock market data verification
  - Validates model effectiveness in real-world financial scenarios

<br>

### b) Training Layer 

- Models built on six heterogeneous backbone architectures

- **Easy-to-use and unified training pipeline**

- Maintains model-agnostic compatibility 

  $$\rightarrow$$ Researchers employing FinTSF paradigm can seamlessly integrate their new models!

<br>

### c) Backtesting Layer 

- Two classic strategies:

  - (1) Topùêæ 
  - (2) Topùêæ-Drop

  with transaction cost simulations reflecting real market conditions

- Comprehensively quantify model capabilities across 11 rigorously wide-used indicators.

<br>

### d) Feedback Layer 

- Archives training logs, preserves prediction results & Provides interactive visualization tools. 
- Facilitates continuous model optimization by tracking performance across training iterations, 

<br>

### Summary

Users only need to deploy their method at the **training layer** & **configuration file**!

$$\rightarrow$$ ***FinTSB can automatically run the pipeline!!***

<br>

# 4. Experiments

## (1) Experiment Setup

### a) Resource

- A100: for LLM-based methods
- V100: for others

<br>

### b) Hyperparameters

- $$L=20$$, $$H=1$$ ( Predict the returns $$Y$$ on the next trading day )
- Hyperparameter searches across multiple sets for optimal results

<br>

### c) Objective 

$$\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{L} \sum_{t=1}^L\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \mid \mid Y_i^t-r_i^t \mid \mid ^2+\eta \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N \max \left(0,-\left(Y_i^t-Y_j^t\right)\left(r_i^t-r_j^t\right)\right)\right)$$.

- Dual-objective optimization framework: Composite loss function that integrates both ...

  - (1) Point-wise regression loss 
  - (2) Pair-wise ranking loss

  ( with adaptive weighting coefficient $$\eta = 5$$ )

  

<br>

## (2) Trading Protocols

### Topùêæ-Drop strategy

- Rather than fully rebalancing holdings daily...
- Retains stocks that persistently rank in the top-ùêæ cohort 
- Only replaces underperformers

$$\rightarrow$$ To **maintain a portfolio** on each trading day!

<br>

### Advantages

- Improves upon Topùêæ strategy by **dynamically optimizing portfolio turnover**

- Reduces the frequency of transactions

  $$\rightarrow$$ Lowering commission costs in proportion to the actual turnover rate

- Maintains exposure to stocks with sustained high scores, avoiding unnecessary exits. 

<br>

### Mathematical expressions

- (On trading day $$t$$) Constructs an **equal-weighted** portfolio of $$m$$ stocks $$\mathcal{P}^t=\left\{s_{i_1}^t, s_{i_2}^t, \ldots, s_{i_m}^t\right\}$$
  - which are selected according to the **rank of predicted returns $$Y$$**
- $$n$$: Maximum number of change
  - Required to fulfill the condition $$ \mid \mathcal{P}^t \cap \mathcal{P}^{t-1} \mid  \geq m-n$$.
- Experiments)
  - (1) Set $$m$$ at one tenth of the total number of stocks, i.e., $$m=30$$, and $$n$$ is set to 5 . 
  - (2) Transaction fee at a rate of $$0.1 \%$$, 

<br>

## (3) Experimental Results

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img697.png)

Summary

- (1) No universal best model!

  - No single method achieves the best performance across all three dimensional metrics!

- (2) Varies significantly even "within" same backbone

- (3) Emergent capabilities of LLM-based approaches

  - Performance **initially deteriorates** with model scaling, but **subsequently shows marked improvement** at larger scales.

    $$\rightarrow$$ Possibly due to the need for ***sufficient parameters*** to disentangle complex market noise and latent factor interactions!

- (4) Modern DL

  - Do not universally outperform traditional quantitative strategies or tree-based models

$$\rightarrow$$ Underscore the importance of considering both

- (1) Model scalability
- (2) FinTS characteristics

<br>

## (4) Transfer Learning Results

To validate the cross-data generalization capability!

$$\rightarrow$$ By applying models pretrained on FinTSB **to backtest the entire 2024 CSI 300 stock market**

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img698.png)

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img699.png)

Two key insights

- (1) Model demonstrates remarkable performance consistency across different market regimes
- (2) Superior risk-adjusted returns achieved through this zero-shot transfer learning paradigm highlight FinTSB‚Äôs unique advantages in both pattern diversity coverage and temporal robustness, establishing it as a comprehensive benchmark for heterogeneous market behaviors spanning bull, bear, and transitional market phases.

<br>

## (5) Inference Efficiency

High demands on system latency sensitivity!

![figure2](/assets/img/ts/img700.png)

<br>

# 5. Conclusion

FinTSB = Comprehensive benchmark for FinTSF

Addresses three key challenges!
