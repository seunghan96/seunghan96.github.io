# 1-1. Why Graphs

## 1) Graphs

= general language for describing & analyzing entities with...

- 1) **"relations" **
- 2) **"interactions"**

<br>

Lots of data are "graphs"!

- ex) computer network, event graphs,...

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img1.png)

<br>

## 2) Types of networks & graphs

Networks ( = Natural Graphs )

- 1) Social networks ( society )
- 2) Communication & Transactions
- 3) Biomedicine ( ex. genes )
- 4) Brain connections ( ex. thoughts )

<br>

Graphs ( = representation )

- 1) information/knowledge
- 2) similarity networks
- 3) relational structures

<br>

Relational Graphs

- model better relationships between entities!

- use DL for complex modeling

<br>

## 3) Networks are complex

Why is it complex?

- arbitrary size & complex structure
- no fixed node ordering or reference point
- dynamic & multi-modal features

<br>

## 4) DL in graphs

[ Input ] 

- **Network**

[ Output ]  (Prediction)

- **1) node labels**
- **2) new links**
- **3) generated graphs / subgraphs**

<br>

Key point : **"Representation Learning"**

- "automatically" learn features with DNN

- map to $d$-dim embeddings
  - similar nodes = similar in embedded space

<br>

<br>

## 5) Outline

- 1) Traditional methods
  - Graphlets, Graph Kernels

- 2) Node Embeddings
  - DeepWalk, Node2vec

- 3) GNN
  - GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT

- 4) Knowledge graph & reasoning
  - TransE, BetaE

- 5) Deep Generative models ( for graphs )

- 6) Applications

<br>

# 1-2. Applications of Graph ML

## 1) Diverse Tasks

- 1) Node classification
  - ex) categorizing users/items
- 2) Link prediction
  - ex) knowledge graph completion
- 3) Graph Classification
  - ex) Molecule property prediction
- 4) Clustering
  - ex) community detection
- 5) etc
  - Graph generation, Graph evolution ..

<br>

### Diverse level of tasks

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img3.png)

<br>

## 2) Example of "NODE-level" ML

### ex) Protein Folding

- Protein 
  - protein= sequence of amino acid
  - 3d structure
  - interact with each other
- Goal : **"predict 3D structure"**, based on **"amino acid sequence"**
- key idea of **AlphaFold** : "spatial graph"
  - (1) node : amino acids
  - (2) edges : proximity between nodes

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img4.png)

<br>

## 3) Example of "EDGE-level" ML

### ex) Recommender Systems

- Formulation
  - (1) node : user & items
  - (2) edge : user & item interaction

- **Goal : "Recommend item to users"**

  ( predict whether 2 nodes are related )

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img5.png)

<br>

### ex) Drug Side Effects

- Background : many patients & many drugs
- Goal : predict **adverse side effects** of **"pair of drugs"**

- Formulation
  - (1) node : drugs & proteins
  - (2) edges : interactions
    - drug-protein interaction
    - protein-protein interaction
    - drug-drug interaction

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img6.png)

<br>

## 4) Example of "SUBGRAPH-level" ML

### ex) Traffic Prediction

- want to move from A to B.... how long will it take?
- Formulation
  - (1) node : road segments
  - (2) edges : connectivity between nodes
- ex) Google Maps : traffic prediction with GNN

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img7.png)

<br>

## 5) Examples of "GRAPH-level" ML

### ex) Drug Discovery

- Antibiotics = small molecular graphs
- Formulation
  - (1) node : atoms
  - (2) edges : chemical bonds
- (Q) Which molecules should be prioritized?
- ex) graph classification model
  - predict promising molecules among candidates

<br>

### ex) Graph generation

- generate novel molecules ( new structure )
  - with "high drug likeness"
  - with "desirable properties"

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img8.png)

<br>

### ex) Physics Simulation

- Formulation
  - (1) node : particles
  - (2) edges : interaction between nodes
- Goal : **predict how a graph will EVOLVE**

<br>

# 1-3. Choice of Graph Representation

## 1) Components of Network

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img9.png)

- (1) Objects : nodes, vertices ( notation : $N$ )

- (2) Interactions : links, edges ( notation : $E$ )

- (3) System : network, graph ( notation : $G(N,E)$ )

<br>

Notation :

- $\mid N \mid$ : number of nodes
- $\mid E \mid$ : number of edges

<br>

[ Question ]

Which one is **proper representation**??

How to build a graph?

- 1) what are nodes?
- 2) what are edges?

<br>

[ Answer ]

- differ by domain/tasks!

<br>

## 2) Directed & Undirected Graphs

**Directed** 

- links = arcs
- ex) phone calls, following in INSTAGRAM

**Undirected**

- links = symmetrical, reciprocal
- ex) collaborations, friendship in FB

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img10.png)

<br>

## 3) Node Degree

 Node degree ( $k_i$ )

- \# of edges, adjacent to node $i$

Average degree

- $\bar{k}=\langle k\rangle=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} k_{i}=\frac{2 E}{N}$.

<br>

### Directed Network

In-degree & Out-degree

<br>

## 4) Bipartite Graph

graph, whose nodes can be divided into "2 disjoint sets $U$, $V$", where ...

**every link connects a node in $U$ to one in $V$**

( = $U$ & $V$ : independent sets )

<br>

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img11.png)

<br>

Example : User-Movie rating

<br>

### Folded / Projected Bipartite Graphs

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img12.png)

<br>

## 5) Adjacency Matrix

Different ways of representing graphs :

- 1) adjacency matrix

- 2) edge list & adjacency list

<br>

**Adjacency Matrix**

$n \times n$ matrix ( $n$ : number of nodes )

- connected = 1
- disconnected = 0

( Undirected Graph : symmetric adjacency matrix )

<br>

Problem(?) : Adjacency matrices are **SPARSE**!

<br>

## 6) Edge list & Adjacency list

Different ways of representing graphs :

- 1) adjacency matrix

- 2) edge list & adjacency list

<br>

**Edge list**

- ex) (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4) ,... (5,2)

<br>

**Adjacency list**

- easier when network is large & sparse
- ex)
  - 1 : 
  - 2 : 3,4
  - 3 : 2,4
  - 4 : 5
  - 5 : 1,2

<br>

## 7) Node & Edge ATTRIBUTES

ex)  weight, ranking, type, sign, ... 

<br>

## 8) More Types of Graphs

unweighted & weighted

- unweighted ( 1 or 0 )
- weighted ( not binary )

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img13.png)

<br>

self-edges & multi-graph

- self-edges ( self-loops )
- multi-graph
  - multiple edges between pair of nodes

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img14.png)

<br>

connected & disconnected graph

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img15.png)

![figure2](/assets/img/gnn/img16.png)

<br>

strongly & weakly connected graph

- strongly : both A-B & B-A path
- weakly : disregard edge direction

<br>

Strongly connected components (SCCs)
