# Abstract

- frame "**Consistency** of dialogue agents" as NLI

- create new NLI dataset, **Dialogue NLI**

  ( model trained on this dataset improved consistency )

<br>

# 1. Introduction

**IN**Consistency example

- Q1) what is your job $$\rightarrow$$ A1) doctor

  Q2) what do you do for a living $$\rightarrow$$ A1) soccer player

<br>

Natural Language Inference (NLI)

- learning a **mapping between sentence pair & entailment category**
- learning **"general sentence representations" & "evaluating NLP models"**

<br>

Proposal : ***"Reduce the problem of consistency in dialogue to NLI"***

- 1) create a dataset, "Dialogue NLI"
- 2) demonstrate that NLI can be used to improve the consistency of dialogue models

<br>

# 2. Dialogue Consistency and Natural Language Inference

### 1) Dialogue generation

( = Next Utterance Prediction )

- $$u_{t+1}$$ is predicted, given conversation prefix $$u_{\leq t}$$

- sequence of utterances = dialogue between agents

  ( $$u_{1}^{A}, u_{2}^{B}, u_{3}^{A}, u_{4}^{B}, \ldots, u_{T}^{B}$$ )

<br>

### 2) Persona-Based Dialogue

- each agent is associated with a persona, $$P_A$$ and $$P_B$$

- **conditionally dependent** on its persona
- typical approach for representing the persona : use a set of sentences!
  - $$P = \{ p_1, ... , p_m \}$$.

<br>

### 3) Consistency

Consistency error

- when agent produces an utterance **that contradicts one of previous utterances**

Persona consistency error

- when agent produces an utterance **that contradicts a subset of its persona**

<br>

### 4) Natural Language Inference

input pair $$(s_1, s_2)$$ $$\rightarrow$$ into one of $$y \in\{\text { entailment, neutral, contradiction }\}$$

- $$s_1$$ : premise
- $$s_2$$ : hypothesis

<br>

### 5) Reducing Dialogue Consistency to NLI

Identifying utterance which contradict **(1) previous utterances** or an **(2) agent's persona** can be reduced,

by assuming that contradictions are contained in a sentence pair.

That is ...

- 1) dialogue contradiction for agent A : contained in utterance pair $$(u_i^A, u_j^A)$$
- 2) persona contradiction : contained in a pair $$(u_i^A, p_k^A)$$

<br>

# 3. Dialogue NLI Dataset

consists of E(entailment), N(neutral), C(contradiction)

sentences originate from two-agent persona-based dialogue dataset

-  dialogue between agents $$A$$ and $$B$$ consists of a sequence of utterances $$u_{1}^{A}, u_{2}^{B}, u_{3}^{A}, u_{4}^{B}, \ldots, u_{T}^{B}$$

-  each agent has a persona represented by a set of persona sentences

  ( $$\left\{p_{1}^{A}, \ldots, p_{m_{A}}^{A}\right\}$$ and $$\left\{p_{1}^{B}, \ldots, p_{m_{B}}^{B}\right\}$$ )

- Dialogue NLI dataset consists of $$\left(u_{i}, p_{j}\right)$$ and $$\left(p_{i}, p_{j}\right)$$ pairs

<br>

## 3-1) Triple Generation

First, **Human labeled triple**

- to determine labels for dataset, require human annotation of utterances & persona sentences

- $$(e_1, r, e_2)$$ with each persona & utterance

  ( ex. (i, have_pet, dog ) )

- explained in 3-2)

<br>

Then,

- Persona sentences & utterances are grouped by their triple!
- explained in 3-1) ( right below )

<br>

**[ Triple Generation ]**

Persona sentences & utterances are grouped by their triple!

( = Pairs ( $$(u,p)$$ and $$(p,p)$$ ) are defined as E, N, C, based on their triple )

- **(a) Entailment** : share same triple

- **(b) Neutral**

  - miscellaneous utterance : $$(u,p)$$ which $$u$$ is not associated with any triple

  - personal pairing : neither redundant nor contradictory

    - pair $$(p,p')$$ is selected from persona, if $$p$$ and $$p'$$ do not share triple

    - then, each sentence associated with the same triple as $$p$$ is paired with each sentence assoicated with the same triple as $$p'$$

  - relation swaps

    - $$(r,r')$$ , whose triples are assumed to represent independent facts 
    - ex) "have_vehicle", "have_pet"
    - $$(\cdot, r, \cdot)$$ and $$(\cdot, r', \cdot)$$

- **(c) Contradiction**

  - contradicting relation pairs $$(r, r')$$
  - $$(e_1, r, e_2)$$ and $$(e_1, r', e_2)$$

<br>

## 3-2) Triple Annotation

- using Amazon Mechanical Turk task

- \<category>\<relation>\<category> rules
